Voro’s Story up till now

  

Voro was raised by the Woodland Elves after the events of Baithwood (his hometown/village/tribe). As a result the captain of the guard (Ulias Brimburn) took him in and raised him as his own. He taught Voro in the ways of marital combat and the magic arts. He was given a signet ring (elven made) to signify Voro's ties to Avallonè. 

  

Voro was trained in the martial ways of war and dabbled in magic with the help of his new found kin.. After coming of age he left his new home in Avallonè and began to adventure with the goal of proving his worth to himself, validating his mothers sacrifice. 

  

Along his journeys he found himself with a ragtag group of people that he eventually took to as his adventuring party. There is strength in numbers after all. 

  

Throughout Voro’s journey to prove his worth he learned through being with his group that just because someone is ‘weaker’ than you does not lessen their worth. People are worth more than their physical strength. On a particular occasion involving a certain Rogue, Voro learned that indeed people are worth saving, despite their faults, shortcomings, or sexual orientation. 

  

At the end of these events he was presented with a choice: to either continue in the ways of martial arts of war, or choose the path of the Abjurer. He chose to lay down his bow and sword and embrace the Arcane and vowed to do no harm, only to save those less fortunate and protect his newly found family. 

  

But that surge of magic did something else to him. He had never experienced that amount of raw power before. He knows something else has changed… What that is, is still to be seen.

Many things have happened since his transformation. Much has been gained, and much has been lost. After the events at the King’s so-called announcement (we have yet to determine that he is actually alive) we all made a run for it. However, Dayne got separated and ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. There he met his demise at the hands of a god. His soul lives on in Shadowfell, a middle-ground as it were for the lost souls. Shortly after this event we gained a new party member named Eroan.

Our current goal is to acquire an army to help the city of Drens which is currently under siege by hobgoblins. 

  

--- Session 24 ---

  

Last we saw Voro he and his friends entered a cave system led by these fish people. Here we were promised an army, but had to do something in return. Maybe looking at a robot army. But we need to get to the core to either shut them down or reprogram them to fight for us. During our travels underground we came across an Aboleth. After defeating the monster we found a large temple underground that led to an alternate dimension. Here we each saw visions. Those visions as of right now have not been disclosed to the group. 

  

It was here that there was a shift in Voro’s mind. Here he saw himself in a library filled with books. Bookshelves tall as the ceiling, field with knowledge, lined in rows. In front of him he saw a smaller shelf with different colored books. Along the books was a black ink-ish magic that covered only some of the books. Filled with curiosity. Voro reached out for the orange book, which was only partly covered in that dark magic. Upon touching the book he saw another vision. This time it was of himself, with power. Power and knowledge beyond his wildest dreams. In that visage he saw the power to save the ones he loves: Dayne, his Mom, his tribe. With that power no one else would have to die or suffer. He could lead his friends into victory, unscathed…untouched… safe. He only needed to reach out and take that power. But just before someone caught his attention. To his right was Eroan, bound in chains, crying out for help. The choice was clear. Voro could either have saved Eroan from whatever fate was to come, or take that power for himself for those he cares for. He looked at Eroan and said, “Sorry kid. I don’t know you.” and reached out for power that was before him. 

  

He felt powerful… yet weak. That feeling of weakness was not new to him, but it was something that he had begun to despise with all his being. This power changed him… fundamentally changed him. His magical ability has increased, but at the cost of his physical strength. This is of little consequence to him.

Story Plot Ideas

  

I would love to see Voro be the keeper of the magic items. So even if it’s not something he can directly use, I think it’d be cool to have and study. Hungry for all knowledge of everything magical. This fits because he believes that if he just acquires more “power” or magic that he’ll be able to protect his friends and not let what happened to Dayne happen again. Ever.

  

This could be a cool dark journey for him… not sure. Still thinking. Maybe he gets a little too power hungry but in the end sacrifices himself for his friends Gandalf style.

  
  

RP Notes

  

Dad was weak. Could not protect his family… nor my mother.

That gnome had to die. For the greater good.

Grim may be necessary evil for the time being. He’s useful.

I know my uses, and they are few. I must change.

Power…to protect.

Dayne is dead. This can never happen again.

This Cygnus is a strange creature. Never seen anything like him. Could be useful.

Knowledge..to protect.

Power… to protect.

  
  

Last Words

  

"Amidst the darkness that has surrounded us, I reflect on our journey together. I was once a young elf, seeking to prove my worth and protect those I love. I've learned the value of camaraderie, the weight of responsibility, and the lure of power. It is in these final moments that I realize the true nature of the choices I've made.

  

I was tempted by the promise of unlimited power, believing that it would shield us from harm. I thought I could protect my friends, prevent another tragedy like Dayne's, and change our destiny. I was wrong. The pursuit of power clouded my judgment, and I lost sight of the most important thing—my friends.

  

In a moment of desperation, I chose the path of power over the path of compassion. I forsook a fellow traveler in need to grasp at something that ultimately eluded me. But I understand now that it was not power I needed—it was the strength of our bonds, the support of my friends, and the knowledge that together, we could overcome any challenge.

  

I implore you all to remember the lessons I have learned too late. The allure of power can lead to a path of darkness, where sacrifices are made, and friendships are broken. Guard against this temptation and hold your friends close. Protect one another. In unity, you will find the strength and courage to face the most formidable of foes.

  

My journey ends here, but yours continues. May you choose a path filled with compassion, camaraderie, and the shared goal of safeguarding each other. In that way, my sacrifice will not be in vain.

  

I leave you now, my friends, with these parting words: protect one another, cherish the moments together, and may your strength come from your unity. Farewell, and may our adventures live on in your hearts."
