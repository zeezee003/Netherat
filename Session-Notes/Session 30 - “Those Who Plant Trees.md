### **Session 30 — “Those Who Plant Trees”**

The battle with the second dragon-horcrux of **[[Karakos]] ([[Chaos]])** was in full swing as two new warriors joined the fray: **[[Wyll Overview]]**, a stoic Human Paladin bearing the weight of old oaths, and **[[Dirge]]**, a Dragonborn Warlock with a hunger for truth and power. Dirge opened his journey with a natural 20—an omen of things to come.

The party brought down the dragon, with [[Dirge]] delivering the final blow. As the creature died, a rune bearing its symbol seared itself into [[Dirge]]’s blade—a mark of something deeper and more dangerous awakening.

With the dragon’s fall, the hobgoblin ranks shattered. The tide of war turned.

After the dust settled, [[Wyll Overview]] honored the fallen, and **[[Karlock]]** had his long-awaited reunion with **[[Dayne]]**. But the moment turned grim—[[Dayne]]’s arm, stretched out, looked withered and dead. [[Karlock]] could do nothing to help.

**[[Cygnus]]**, now fully integrated with the underground machine-city and its mech army, appeared before you in a pristine, digital form—eerily resembling a young Jude Law. His cryptic farewell hung heavy in the air:

> _“Those who plant trees never receive the shade they bring.”_  
> _“I have to tend the garden now, but I will see you again.”_

As a final twist, players were offered a chance to draw from a deck of mysterious gifts. [[Karlock]], of course, drew from the **Deck of Many Things**—and was engulfed in a pillar of infernal fire.

There, he faced **[[Karlock's Devil|The Devil]]** once more—the one who had first appeared after the gnome bard’s execution long ago. The devil revealed **[[Karakos]]’s true aim**: to tilt [[the Blood War]] in favor of the demons, unseating the [[Nine Hells]] and claiming dominion over all realms.

A deal was struck.

> _“If you need me, I will be there. If I call, you will answer.”_  
> [[Karlock]] agreed. The flames vanished. So did he.

Not long after, a column of elite dwarves in shining gold plate arrived—riding war-goats and led by **[[Bozmirra]]**, a noble warrior who invited the party into **[[Drens]]**, the mountain city they had just saved.

Inside the throne room, two thrones stood: one occupied by a young, elegant dwarf prince—clearly displeased with your presence—and the other claimed by [[Bozmirra]]. The prince offered cold civility before retreating behind chamber doors with his entourage. [[Bozmirra]], warm and sincere, promised to speak again soon and followed after him.

Left alone, **[[Dayne]]** couldn’t resist. The prince’s chamber door had been left slightly ajar. Inside, on a cluttered desk, [[Dayne]] found a sealed scroll with a strange mark. Reaching for it, he triggered a magical alarm—an enchanted skull letting out a wailing shriek through the royal hall.
