### Session 19 Summary — _Chases, Caves, and Chains_

In the chaotic aftermath of the palace square battle, [[Jons]] appeared with options for the party’s next move—but [[Callum]] wasted no time, sprinting off with a call to regroup at the stables. What followed was a tense, desperate chase through the city streets.

Meanwhile, [[Dayne]] discovered a hidden path behind a dumpster—a secret dugout cavern that promised quick escape. But the hope for safety was short-lived: the group stumbled into a vast Kobold colony and were swiftly captured.

Hidden beneath [[Cailin]]’s stables, the rest of the party eavesdropped on a high-stakes encounter: a Harathan Paladin general named [[Surge Wolfsbane]] halted the fleeing crown, his brutal voice unmistakable to [[Callum]].

Meanwhile, [[Dayne]] was escorted by a mysterious, ancient white Kobold speaking common to a cavernous chamber. There, chained by enormous shackles, lay a [[colossal black dragon]], its cracked scales glowing with molten lava beneath.

And that’s where the session ended—on the edge of danger and revelation.
