### Session 36 — “The Dragon’s Judgment”**

The city of [[Anguis]] trembles beneath the weight of rising tension. After [[Jingles]]’ stunning victory over the [[balgura]] in the pit, applause fades into uneasy silence as darker forces stir beneath the surface.

[[Dayne]] and [[Gal]] remain bound to [[Karlock]]’s devilish pact, their fates tethered to infernal chains that shadow every choice. Meanwhile, [[Jingles]] is drawn through [[Anguis]]’s winding corridors to a caged figure—**[[Sylen, the Platinum Dragon]]**, trapped in human form.

With unsettling calm, [[Sylen, the Platinum Dragon|Sylen]] frees himself and unlocks a searing vision in [[Jingles]]’ mind: a young [[Jingles]] witnessing his tribe’s massacre, [[a silver dragon]] bursting forth in a blaze of light and fury. The memory crashes over him like thunder.

Before disappearing in a swirl of silver mist, [[Sylen]] brutally dispatches two orc guards—making [[Jingles]] and [[Gal]] wanted for murder.

Suddenly, the city’s alarms wail as a **massive [[gold dragon]]—[[Orin]]—descends**, casting a shadow over the battlements. His eyes burn with unyielding purpose.

You manage to hold the beast’s fury at bay, but [[Orin]]’s message is clear: trust is broken, and earning it back will come at a steep price.

With wings spread wide and chest glowing like molten metal, [[Orin]] prepares to put on a show that will decide your fate in [[Anguis]]—and perhaps beyond.
