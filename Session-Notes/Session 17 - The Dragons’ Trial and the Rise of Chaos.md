### Session 17 Summary — _The Dragons’ Trial and the Rise of Chaos_

The party found themselves in a vast chamber with two massive, freshly dug graves—evidence that powerful dragons had recently been resurrected and then vanished. As they explored, they noticed [[Orin]] growing weaker with every passing moment in this cursed place.

They entered a strange circular chamber after laying down their arms, where three colored stones forced each party member into maddening speech curses—testing their wits and patience. Solving the riddle allowed them to press onward.

In another trial, the group chose between sacrificing sight or hearing, which led them to a colossal sphinx guarding the next threshold. After besting the sphinx’s riddle, they confronted a powerful caster—revealed to be [[Harold]], presumed dead and the cultist leader known as [[The Shadow]]. The party defeated him, but not before he shattered a mystical glass vessel, releasing the spirit of an ancient elf who ominously declared that chaos would return.

The battle culminated with the arrival of an ancient [[black dragon]] smashing through a sealed door. [[Orin]] revealed his true power, wielding a spear and an awe-inspiring golden dragon-scale shield as he faced the beast. The spirit of the ancient elf merged with the [[black dragon]], proclaiming the end of order and the dawn of chaos before vanishing.

[[Orin]] then transformed into a colossal [[golden dragon]], clashing fiercely with the [[black dragon]]. The battle tore the building’s roof apart as the [[black dragon]] escaped, only to be joined in the sky by [[five more chromatic dragons]]—heralds of an impending age of chaos.
