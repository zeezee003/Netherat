### _Session 11: The Altar by the Sea_

_The winds of [[Netherat]] carry whispers, but none louder than what was found in that cage._

Last session picked up immediately after the confrontation in the woods. In the battered remnants of the [[Sons of Embar]]'s caravan, you discovered him: a **16-year-old [[Eladrin Boy]]**, unconscious, delicate features sunken but untouched by time. Magic _bled_ off him in waves—fey magic, old and unyielding.

You brought him with you, your path bending toward the coast as [[Ciwin]] instructed. There, you found it: **[[the altar by the sea]]**.

Weather-beaten and half-sunken in brine, the altar was unmistakably tied to the same rituals you interrupted in the [[Sarthall]] sewers. Strange runes, stained stone, the scent of rot clinging to the wind.

That’s when **[[Jons]]** arrived—Captain of the Guard, grizzled and reliable. He’d been tracking you, or perhaps the child, and wanted answers.
