### _Session 13: The Sword’s Whisper and the Frozen Gate_

_Truth broke like ice beneath your feet._

In the smoldering silence after the Kenku siege, **[[Dayne]] confessed the truth**: the mysterious “Alred” he had been speaking to wasn’t a man at all—but **a voice bound to the cursed sword** taken from the haunted manor. The same sword that burned [[Thag]] on contact. The same sword now whispering only to [[Dayne]].

The party, unsure whether to fear or pity their companion, agreed to **seek [[Ciwin]]’s guidance in [[Sarthall]]. But while they traveled, we flashed back—[[Galvatross]]**, already days ahead with the rescued elven boy, was **ambushed by goblins**. The Earth Genasi made short work of them, standing alone and undefeated, continuing toward the burning skyline.

[[Sarthall]], once a haven, was **under siege.** Pillars of smoke marked a devastating raid—this time not just zealots, but **[[agents of Chaos]]**, flying the banner of one only known as **“[[The Shadow]].”** You reunited with [[Galvatross]], calm atop a **hill of dead cultists**, and together entered the ravaged palace.

Inside, **[[Ciwin]] wasted no time**. He declared that the being inside [[Dayne]] wasn’t a minor possession—it was a **demonic hitchhiker of unknown depth and origin**, and even he could not extract it safely. But he had one lead: a **druid named [[Galdore]]**, an estranged ally from his adventuring days, who lived **beneath the frozen lake near [[Drens]]**.

But before you could leave, the **[[Paladins of Haratha]]** arrived in force—holy warriors from a distant city, their **leader golden-haired and soft-voiced**, but radiating the **undeniable authority of divine power.** Their presence, already tense, escalated when **[[Dayne]] stabbed one**.

You were seconds from a full **party wipe.** That was the cost of one decision.

But **[[Karlock]] chose mercy**—casting _healing_ rather than _harm_—and that **bought you time.** [[Ciwin]] froze the moment with a **time stop**, shoved you out the door, and a young boy named [[Cailin]] waited with **fresh horses.** You escaped—barely.

And then the lake.

Standing on its frozen face, **[[Callum]] shouted the name “[[Harold]],”** and [[Dayne]], possessed blade in hand, reached toward the ice. It shattered. The water below was not cold—but warm, and deep, and waiting.

A **massive killer whale**—no ordinary beast—**dragged [[Callum]] under**, down toward a glowing wreck. One by one, the rest of you dove after him. Just before blacking out, you felt a snap—

—then air, wind, moonlight.

You awoke aboard a **ghostly galleon**, sailing a **still sea beneath a perfect sky**. And at the helm, half-shrouded in moonlight, stood a **weathered pirate**, coat flared, one hand on the wheel.

His eyes met yours.
