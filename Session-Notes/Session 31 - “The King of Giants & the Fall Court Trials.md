### **Session 31 — “The King of Giants & the Fall Court Trials”**

Still inside the **throne room of [[Drens]]**, things took a turn when **[[Dayne]]**, ever curious, snuck into the chambers of the petulant dwarven prince. He disturbed an object on the prince’s desk—triggering a trap that phased him into an **alternate dimension**, unseen and unreachable by the rest of the party.

The rest of you worked quickly to solve the puzzle: a **talking skull**, a **bug-shaped quill**, and an **enchanted ink well**. After a few flubbed attempts (and some chaos), the trap was finally broken and [[Dayne]] returned, just as an old, robed dwarf was escorted into the hall.

The man turned out to be no threat—in fact, he was the **father of the royal twins**, and surprisingly chill. Karlock questioned him about a mysterious **green gemstone** with a fiery center. The old king revealed it was a portal key—one that would open a rift to [[**Ciwin]]’s prison**.

Meanwhile, **[[Jingles]]**, increasingly smitten with the dwarven princess, tried to win her father's favor. The old king spoke of a **[[prophecy]]**: a true **[[King of Giants]]** would reunite their shattered race and bring peace—but only if they could recover three legendary relics:

- _The Hammer of Thunderbolts_
    
- _The Belt of Giant Strength_
    
- _The Gauntlets of Ogre Power_
    

Moved by something unspoken, the king embraced [[Jingles]] and discreetly slipped a **ring** into his pocket.

Then, without hesitation, he smashed the green gem—tearing open a portal—and the party stepped through.

You emerged in a **dungeon beneath a Feywild palace**, sneaking carefully through its winding halls. Overheard voices led you to a high balcony, where the **rulers of the four Feywild courts**—Spring, Summer, Winter, and Fall—argued bitterly. They blamed each other for the ongoing, unnatural **seasonal stagnation**, particularly the Winter Court's growing influence. The bickering lords exited to what appeared to be a stadium’s luxury box.

You followed.

Peering into the arena, you saw **three captives bound to poles**: a satyr, your old friend **[[Ciwin]]**, and **[[Natalie Portman]]**. The leader of the Fall Court addressed the crowd as a monstrous **giant toad** lumbered toward [[Ciwin]].

You had heard enough. The team **leapt into the arena**, shattering the rules of this macabre spectacle and triggering a full-blown battle. During the fight, something—perhaps one of your strikes or spells—**disabled the forcefield** enclosing the palace. The audience went wild.

You defeated the frog monster… but not without loss: **[[Natalie Portman]] was swallowed whole**, disappearing into the belly of the beast.

Just as the Fall Court leader tried to rein in the chaos and address you, a **troll—launched like a catapult round—**hurtled through the air and smashed directly into the luxury box, splattering the Fall Court ruler across the stone**.

The crowd roared again—but not in celebration.  
This wasn’t over.
