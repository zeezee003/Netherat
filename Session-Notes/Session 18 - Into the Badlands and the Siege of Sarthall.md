### Session 18 Summary — _Into the Badlands and the Siege of Sarthall_

After [[Orin]] fully revealed his [[golden dragon]] form and shared vital history about [[Karakos]] and the reborn dragons, he set off north to confront loyalists still backing [[the chromatic dragons]]. Meanwhile, [[Karlock]] used a new divine ability to probe deeper into [[King Ithrid]]’s secrets, uncovering tantalizing clues about the realm’s fragile power structure.

The party chose the quickest route to [[Sarthall]], cutting through the harsh, unforgiving [[Badlands]] for the first time. The land itself seemed alien and hostile—dunes shifting like a living beast—until suddenly a massive sandworm erupted from the earth, devouring an unseen target far off. The group barely escaped with their lives, a stark reminder that the [[Badlands]] were no place for the faint-hearted.

Arriving at [[Sarthall]], they bypassed city guards through a risky assault and a difficult climb over the walls. Inside, the party linked up with [[Cailin]], who appeared to be working covertly against the oppressive paladins dominating the city.

[[Cailin]] entrusted [[Dayne]] with a mysterious packet meant for distraction—but when crushed, it exploded, injuring several and mysteriously producing a fleeting, cryptic card. The ensuing battle with twelve paladins was brutal; [[Jingles]] emerged as the deadliest, but [[Callum]] nearly fell—saved only by [[Voro]]’s protective magic and swift healing.

The session closed amidst the chaos and aftermath of this fierce conflict.
