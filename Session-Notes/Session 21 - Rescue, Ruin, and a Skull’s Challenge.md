### Session 21 Recap — _Rescue, Ruin, and a Skull’s Challenge_

The party raced through the caverns near the [[Grimm Family Casino]] after [[Ciwin]]’s urgent warning: [[Jons]] was captured and sentenced to hang in the city square. Braving waves of paladins and the ruthless [[Garold Grimtower]], you fought fiercely to free three prisoners—one revealed to be the legendary [[Damathos]], who disappeared as quickly as he was saved, promising to return. The identity and fate of the third figure remain shadowed (Tucker to fill in).

Mid-battle, the palace tower shattered as a wyvern soared onto the roof, carrying a black-armored figure crowned with a horned helmet. Wretched monsters clawed up from the earth, turning the fight toward this dark menace. Just as all seemed lost, [[Ciwin]] clashed fiercely with the figure—revealed to be a lich version of the Shadow, more powerful than ever.

The party escaped the ensuing chaos, retreating to a tavern where a mysterious, milky-eyed dwarf whispered of a legendary mountain beneath [[Drens]] harboring a sleeping army of machines—the only hope against the hobgoblin siege.

As sleep settled, a sudden crash and burst of light jolted you awake. [[Karlock]]’s perception check triggered a wild magic surge, sending a magical shield and a broken sword glowing into the sky before vanishing with the scent of cedar and cigar smoke. Approaching the disturbance, your new ally [[Eoran]] encountered a talking skull that demanded, “Who the F are you?”
