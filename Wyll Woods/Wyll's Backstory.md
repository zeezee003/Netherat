# Backstory:

Wyll Woods, Paladin of the Crown, once a humble child born in the barracks of Sarthal, was destined for a life dedicated to the principles of justice, honor, and loyalty. His family served the city guard for generations, instilling in Wyll a deep reverence for the law. His father, Captain Haldor Woods, was a renowned figure within the guard, renowned for his unwavering commitment to upholding the city's values.

From a young age, Wyll idolized his father's sense of duty and sought to emulate him. He grew up surrounded by tales of heroic guards, chivalrous paladins, and the legendary deeds of the Sarthal protectors. The city's motto, "Justice, Honor, Loyalty," was imprinted in his heart.

At the tender age of sixteen, Wyll's father enrolled him in the Guard's training program. The young squire embraced the rigorous training, honing his combat skills, and deepening his understanding of the law. He took his oaths as a Paladin of the Crown, pledging to safeguard the city and its ideals with the same fervor that had guided his ancestors.

Wyll's career in the City Guard was marked by a tireless pursuit of justice. He was unyielding in his commitment to root out corruption and wrongdoing within Sarthal. He became known for his expertise in solving complex cases and his reputation for never letting a criminal escape the grasp of the law.

One fateful day, the disappearance of Jons, a trusted comrade and a mentor to Wyll, sent shockwaves through the Guard. The strange rise of the Harartha Paladins and the sudden appearance of the King added to Wyll's growing unease. He believed that these outsiders posed a threat to the very essence of Sarthal's values.

Wyll found himself at a crossroads. His oath bound him to protect Sarthal, but he questioned if it was time to protect the city from those who would subvert its principles. The enigmatic figure Ciwin further deepened his uncertainty. Ciwin's motives were unclear, and Wyll approached him with caution, sensing that he held vital information about the city's secrets.

The siege of Drens was a topic whispered about in hushed tones, its details shrouded in mystery. Wyll knew that the knowledge of this event depended on how much the city's leaders were willing to reveal. Nevertheless, Wyll remained vigilant, for he understood that his role as an Inspector was to uncover the truth, no matter how well it was hidden.

Throughout his career, Wyll's disdain for the Redd Grimm family grew into an all-consuming hatred. He saw them as the embodiment of chaos and disorder in Sarthal, a constant threat to the order he had sworn to protect. He had, indeed, arrested a member of the Redd Grimm family in the past, but somehow, the charges never stuck, fueling his determination to bring them to justice.

Wyll's journal remained a testament to his unwavering commitment to justice, protection, loyalty, and the unwavering belief in the law. It was a chronicle of his relentless pursuit of truth and his journey to keep the city he loved safe from those who sought to undermine its foundations.
