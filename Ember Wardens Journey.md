### _Session 3: Strange Fire and Shifting Paths_

The trail led them to a secluded cave where kobolds huddled around a cloaked figure, deep in hushed conversation. Before the party could intervene, the figure vanished into the treeline, leaving only scaled minions behind. [[Dayne]] made an attempt to sneak closer—but whatever grace he had in mind was met with immediate detection. The kobolds hissed, retreated, and combat erupted before the party could even enter the cave mouth.

Outnumbered, the fight was rough. Among the enemies stood one kobold larger than the rest—armed, brutal, and clearly in command. But the group held their ground, blades flashing and spells flying, until the last of the attackers lay broken.

Inside the cave, they barricaded themselves and rested. By lanternlight, they examined strange barrels filled with purplish rock-like material—half crystalline, half organic. [[Callum]], curious and cautious, took one with them as they left the next morning.

But dawn revealed something more troubling: the kobold corpses they’d left behind had been torn apart. Not scavenged—_devoured_. Flesh shredded, bones split. Something had come in the night. Something not interested in mercy.

Avoiding the main roads, the group made for [[Sarthall]] through the woods. Just before the city gates, they buried the barrel in secret and entered the town, seeking answers.

There, they met [[Jons]], the weathered captain of the guard, barking orders at young recruits. [[Voro]] wasted no time—showing the soldiers how a real bowman moves. He struck targets with precision, and the young martial took notice. The magic in him hadn't surfaced yet… but the moment hinted at something stirring beneath the surface.

[[Jons]] agreed to help. Two guards joined the group to retrieve the hidden barrel—but when they returned to the site, they found only a hole. The barrel was gone. Just a smear of the strange purple substance remained in the dirt.

Then [[Crag]], one of the guards, tasted it.

A mistake—or maybe destiny.

His veins bulged, pulsing with violet light. His muscles swelled grotesquely as power surged through him. With a roar, he hurled a massive club, burying it into a thick tree. And then—calmly, deliberately—he conjured a flickering purple flame in his hand.

Something was changing. The substance wasn’t just strange—it was _alive_ with power.

---
### _Session 4: Grimms and Gamblefire_

The strange purple trail left behind by the missing barrel drew the party’s attention. They followed its drag marks through the woods until the trail faded. Whatever had taken the barrel was strong—and deliberate.

Returning to [[Sarthall]], the party checked in with Captain [[Jons]] before making their way to the palace. There, they met with the court wizard, [[Ciwin]]—a reclusive scholar whose mind had long been bent toward studying the mad zealots and the strange violet dust that seemed tied to their transformation. [[Ciwin]] confirmed their suspicions: the purple substance was alchemical, volatile, and increasingly common in zealot activity. He advised investigating a sewer entrance hidden behind the [[Grimm Family Casino]].

The group headed to the casino under dusk’s heavy sky. Inside, neon glitz met bloodsport. They met [[Hank Grimm]], one of the infamous brothers who ran the joint, and placed bets on the evening's pit fights—one of the city’s more brutal pastimes.

Fate had other plans.

When a contestant collapsed mid-event from a heart attack, the announcer,[[ Mike Grimm]], turned to the crowd. He needed fresh blood. His gaze locked on [[Callum]]. “You,” he said. “Get in.”

[[Callum]] stepped into the ring. The crowd roared.

He fought well—nimble, fierce—but was ultimately defeated in the quarterfinals by a halfling brawler named _[[Halfroc]]_. [[Halfroc]] proved himself in the ring, eventually taking the championship by laying out a known predator named [[Damathos]] to wild cheers.

Despite the loss, [[Callum]]’s courage didn’t go unnoticed. He was invited to the exclusive VIP section behind the fight pit. With the blood of battle still drying on his skin, he stepped through the velvet-draped doorway—into a world of secrets the public wasn’t meant to see.

---
### _Session 5: Blood, Slime, and Secrets Below_

The VIP lounge of the [[Grimm Family Casino]] pulsed with smoke, synth-jazz, and whispered deals. Among the lavish crowd, the party overheard a scuffle—a guard was shoving a stone-skinned Earth Genasi toward the exit. The man’s name was _[[Galvatross]]_, and his only crime was standing out. [[Callum]] stepped in, leveling his voice and his stance, and the party quickly made a new ally.

Winnings in hand, they finally met _[[Redd Grimm]]_—the silver-tongued patriarch of the Grimm brothers. He wore his charm like armor, his menace just beneath the smile. After some casual banter and a handshake that felt like a veiled threat, he handed them a sealed envelope. No explanation. No instructions. They haven’t opened it.

After a round of drinks (and [[Dayne]] enjoying the scenery a little too openly), the group remembered their purpose and descended into the city’s underbelly—the sewers [[Ciwin]] had marked.

The stink hit first, then the shadows. Barely into the tunnels, a shivering junkie named _[[Jake]]_ begged them to find his brother _[[Rob]]_. A few corridors later, they found him—too late. A ghoul was hunched over [[Rob]]’s shredded corpse, and two more joined as the party engaged.

The battle was swift and brutal. Steel rang, spells hissed, and the undead were put down—though one slinked off into the dark. The group, bloodied but intact, chose the risk of a rest in the filth.

It didn’t last.

They were jolted awake by the hungry slither of an ooze. Blinded by sleep and darkness, they scrambled to their feet and carved the thing apart in a messy, desperate fight.

The sewers weren’t just dangerous—they were _watching_. And something down there _knew_ they were coming.

---
### _Session 6: Bone Serpents and Black Altars_

The stink of rot thickened as the party pushed deeper into the sewers. At a fork in the path, [[Galvatross]] closed his eyes, divine sense radiating outward like a ripple through tainted water. He turned left—undead lingered there. The party followed.

They found the last ghoul from their earlier skirmish, still lurking in the shadows. It didn’t last long. A flash of steel and spell dropped it where it stood. The group pocketed a modest stash of coin from the remains before doubling back to explore the other route.

That path led to a chamber—large, echoing, flickering with torchlight. A stone altar stood at its center, and five robed zealots surrounded it, chanting feverishly, their eyes wild with madness.

[[Galvatross]] cloaked the party in shadow and silence with _Pass Without Trace_. They crept forward unseen, breath held, blades ready. But before they could strike, the lead cultist drove a dagger into his own chest, screaming a final phrase as blood splattered across the altar.

The stone shook. From the depths of the sewer, something _answered_.

A [[colossal skeletal serpent]] erupted from the ground, bones grinding and magic humming between its ribs. The room exploded into chaos.

[[Callum]] dropped one zealot with a clean, concussive strike—alive, but unconscious. A prisoner for [[Ciwin]]. [[Dayne]] was nearly taken down, paralyzed by the beast’s necrotic venom, his fate hanging by a thread until [[Karlock]] intervened, casting _Lesser Restoration_ just in time.

The tide turned.

[[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] unleashed a hail of damage, wearing the creature down piece by piece. And then, with divine light arcing off his blade, [[Callum]] smote the beast into dust, bones shattering in a radiant blast.

The chamber fell still. One zealot remained, unconscious. The summoning had failed. But something worse now stirred in the deep.
### _Session 7: Songs in the Sewer and Secrets on the Coast_

The bone serpent lay shattered, and the party emerged from the sewers with blood on their boots and questions in their pockets. They split up—two went to answer [[Redd Grimm]]’s summons, the others to report back to [[Ciwin]] with the captured zealot.

**[[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] and [[Callum]]**, ever the loyal lackeys (and somehow forgetful), showed up at Redd’s estate empty of context. They hadn’t read the sealed letter he gave them. After some awkward small talk with the crime boss—whose smile always seems like it’s daring you to betray him—they slipped out and cracked the letter open. It instructed them to visit a tavern called _[[Rapscallion’s]]_.

Meanwhile, **[[Dayne]], [[Galvatross]], and [[Karlock]]** delivered the unconscious zealot to [[Ciwin]]. They found him in the company of high-ranking soldiers—strange men not from [[Sarthall]], wearing the kind of armor that looks ceremonial until you see the bloodstains. [[Ciwin]] praised their efforts, confirmed that similar altars had been reported near the coast, and rewarded [[Karlock]] with a _Wand of Healing_—a rare and potent gift.

The party reunited and went to _[[Rapscallion’s]]_, playing along with the coded instructions. A secret drink. A hidden message. The phrase they deciphered?

**“Kill the Bard Gnome.”**

And sure enough, the night’s entertainment was a gnome plucking away on a lute, singing to a room that had no idea it was witnessing his final set.

You kidnapped him. You killed him. You dumped his body into the city’s filth-ridden river like a broken instrument.

But [[Karlock]] saw something. Just for a second: a skeletal figure *([[Karlock's Devil]])* cloaked in ghostlight, pressing a finger to his lips.

_Shh._

You left the city the next morning and headed for the coast, stopping in a quiet village called _[[Bellwood]]_. There, a job caught your eye—a contract to clear out an old, abandoned manor nearby.

You arrived just before dusk, wind pushing against the creaking wood of the place. You peered over the hill at the decaying house, its windows like blind eyes watching you back.

Something’s waiting inside.
### _Session 9: The Stone Curse and the Silent Girl_

The manor loomed like a forgotten memory, wind rustling the trees as the party crept onto its grounds. The statues lining the yard weren’t just eerie—they were _frozen mid-motion_, their poses tense, fearful. Something had caught them in the act of fleeing.

[[Dayne]] slipped ahead, entering the barn unseen. Inside, gnashing and tearing echoed in the darkness—a massive _basilisk_ feasting on a half-eaten horse.

Combat exploded across the courtyard. Steel met scale. But not before [[Dayne]] locked eyes with the beast—and froze, petrified in mid-action, a living statue now among the others.

The battle was bloody but brief. When the creature fell, its eyes crystallized into two dark gemstones, humming with latent power. The party gathered around their frozen comrade, channeling divine energy. With _three combined castings of Lesser Restoration_, [[Dayne]]’s stony flesh cracked and gave way to life once more.

The manor itself waited with breathless malice.

Inside, you found the corpse of a lone adventurer—clearly trying to flee something unseen. In his hands, two items: a strange _lantern_ and an exquisite _[[pirate’s cutlass]]_. [[Dayne]] claimed the sword without hesitation. [[Galvatross]] took the lantern, discovering its power: it revealed ghostly imprints of the past—echoes burned into reality.

Room by room, the manor told its story. A girl’s voice, faint sobs, fleeting figures disappearing around corners. Her toys, her dress, her comb—all scattered and stained by time. The house _remembered_ her. And now, so did you.

Each of you was tested—by fear, by memory, by guilt. And each of you emerged changed, stronger for having touched the pain soaked into this place.

In the servants’ quarters, you placed a toy car inside a fallen toy box. A figure appeared in the hall where you’d first entered. A little girl, eyes empty, sadness clinging to her like shadow.

She raised a finger to her lips.

_Shh._

### _Session 10: Fire, Theft, and the Caged Child_

_Netherat's shadows run deep—even in daylight._

The session opened in the quiet coastal town of **[[Bellwood]]**, at a weathered tavern known as _[[The Book and the Blade]]_. [[Dayne]], brooding over his pirate’s cutlass, was struck by a sudden, jarring memory: his old companion [[Thag]], curious about the weapon, had once grasped it—only for it to sear his hands and pin him to the floor. [[Thag]] had snarled a warning: _"Get that thing out of here."_

Whatever this sword is, it’s _wrong_. It remembers too much.

After a long rest, the party stopped at **[[CDXX Herbs & Such]]**, where you met the mellow and suspiciously-named **[[Chandler Bong]]**. You shared a few jokes, earned his trust, and Dayne promptly robbed him. Old habits. New consequences.

Leaving [[Bellwood]] behind, your road curved toward the coast—until you crossed paths with a heavily armored group hauling a covered cart. Something was off. You followed at a distance as the group veered into the woods. When night fell, you struck.

Combat erupted in the dark, steel and spell colliding. These were no mere mercs. They were the **[[Sons of Embar]]**—fanatics devoted to purging magic. [[Callum]] was shackled with an _anti-magic manacle_, and [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] was nearly cut down in the skirmish.

When the dust settled and the Sons lay dead, you approached their cart. [[Callum]], his divine sense tingling, _felt something fey_. [[Dayne]] ripped off the sheet.

Inside: [[Eladrin Boy]]. Elven. Barely sixteen. Unconscious.

A prisoner of zealots. A mystery in flesh.
### _Session 11: The Altar by the Sea_

_The winds of [[Netherat]] carry whispers, but none louder than what was found in that cage._

Last session picked up immediately after the confrontation in the woods. In the battered remnants of the [[Sons of Embar]]'s caravan, you discovered him: a **16-year-old [[Eladrin Boy]]**, unconscious, delicate features sunken but untouched by time. Magic _bled_ off him in waves—fey magic, old and unyielding.

You brought him with you, your path bending toward the coast as [[Ciwin]] instructed. There, you found it: **[[the altar by the sea]]**.

Weather-beaten and half-sunken in brine, the altar was unmistakably tied to the same rituals you interrupted in the [[Sarthall]] sewers. Strange runes, stained stone, the scent of rot clinging to the wind.

That’s when **[[Jons]]** arrived—Captain of the Guard, grizzled and reliable. He’d been tracking you, or perhaps the child, and wanted answers.

### _Session 12: Fortress of Feathers and Blood_

_Steel sang on black wings._

Last session opened at the base of a **fortress carved into the jagged cliffs**—a crude, weather-beaten stronghold belonging to the **Kenku**, those mimic-voiced scavengers who speak only in echoes of the dead.

Your party stormed the keep in a full assault, blades drawn, spells loosed. **The battle was brutal**, the Kenku fighting with erratic precision, ambushing from the shadows, shrieking in a chorus of stolen phrases. One of them echoed words _you_ had said earlier—_someone's been listening._

You fought your way through rusted gates and narrow halls, smoke filling your lungs as feathers littered the floor like snow. The enemy was clever, coordinated—but not clever enough.

By the time the dust settled, the Kenku lay broken, and their fortress lay quiet.
### _Session 13: The Sword’s Whisper and the Frozen Gate_

_Truth broke like ice beneath your feet._

In the smoldering silence after the Kenku siege, **[[Dayne]] confessed the truth**: the mysterious “Alred” he had been speaking to wasn’t a man at all—but **a voice bound to the cursed sword** taken from the haunted manor. The same sword that burned [[Thag]] on contact. The same sword now whispering only to [[Dayne]].

The party, unsure whether to fear or pity their companion, agreed to **seek [[Ciwin]]’s guidance in [[Sarthall]]. But while they traveled, we flashed back—[[Galvatross]]**, already days ahead with the rescued elven boy, was **ambushed by goblins**. The Earth Genasi made short work of them, standing alone and undefeated, continuing toward the burning skyline.

[[Sarthall]], once a haven, was **under siege.** Pillars of smoke marked a devastating raid—this time not just zealots, but **[[agents of Chaos]]**, flying the banner of one only known as **“[[The Shadow]].”** You reunited with [[Galvatross]], calm atop a **hill of dead cultists**, and together entered the ravaged palace.

Inside, **[[Ciwin]] wasted no time**. He declared that the being inside [[Dayne]] wasn’t a minor possession—it was a **demonic hitchhiker of unknown depth and origin**, and even he could not extract it safely. But he had one lead: a **druid named [[Galdore]]**, an estranged ally from his adventuring days, who lived **beneath the frozen lake near [[Drens]]**.

But before you could leave, the **[[Paladins of Haratha]]** arrived in force—holy warriors from a distant city, their **leader golden-haired and soft-voiced**, but radiating the **undeniable authority of divine power.** Their presence, already tense, escalated when **[[Dayne]] stabbed one**.

You were seconds from a full **party wipe.** That was the cost of one decision.

But **[[Karlock]] chose mercy**—casting _healing_ rather than _harm_—and that **bought you time.** [[Ciwin]] froze the moment with a **time stop**, shoved you out the door, and a young boy named [[Cailin]] waited with **fresh horses.** You escaped—barely.

And then the lake.

Standing on its frozen face, **[[Callum]] shouted the name “[[Harold]],”** and [[Dayne]], possessed blade in hand, reached toward the ice. It shattered. The water below was not cold—but warm, and deep, and waiting.

A **massive killer whale**—no ordinary beast—**dragged [[Callum]] under**, down toward a glowing wreck. One by one, the rest of you dove after him. Just before blacking out, you felt a snap—

—then air, wind, moonlight.

You awoke aboard a **ghostly galleon**, sailing a **still sea beneath a perfect sky**. And at the helm, half-shrouded in moonlight, stood a **weathered pirate**, coat flared, one hand on the wheel.

His eyes met yours.

> _“Few know my dwelling place, and fewer have the wisdom nor the stones to reach it.  
> What business do you have here?”_

### _Session 14: The Shadow, the Storm, and the Dagger_

_Not all battles are fought with blades._

You stood aboard the phantom vessel of **[[Galdore]]**, the ancient druid who abandoned the surface world for a sea beneath the ice. The air was thick with threat as **swords floated around him like sharks**, waiting for his command. But words—steady and measured—stayed the blades.

Yet **[[Dayne]] was already unraveling.** The pressure, the possession, the truths left unspoken—he broke for the edge of the boat. _[[Karlock]]_, rolling a natural 20, **tackled him to the deck**, saving him from diving into madness or sea.

[[Galdore]] asked **[[Callum]]** a single question: _“Do you trust me?”_ Then, with no hesitation, drove a **dagger of ancient make** into [[Dayne]]’s ribs.

### _Descent._

[[Dayne]] fell into darkness—and into **memory**.

- **A field near his childhood home**, swallowed by shadow.
    
- _[[Alred]] voice_: corrosive, relentless. “You’ve failed everyone.”
    
- A **vision of a twisted, monstrous Callum** emerged—_a manifestation of self-hatred_—and struck him down.
    

### _Scene Shift._

- **The family cabin.** The past breathed here.
    
- [[Galvatross]]’ voice _pierced the noise_. That clarity revealed the truth: _[[Alred]] wasn’t a voice of guilt. He was a demon of possession. A liar. A parasite._
    
- Its true form was revealed—twisted, sneering, patient.
    

### _Scene Shift Again._

- **[[The Helix]]**, where [[Dayne]] grew into himself. But even here, _[[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]_’s presence couldn't reach him.
    
- The shadow-possessed [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] stepped forward—and **attacked**.
    

### _Final Scene: The Ship of the Father._

- The true battlefield.
    
- [[Dayne]] stood aboard his father’s vessel—**the place of legacy**.
    
- _[[Karlock]]’s voice was a lighthouse through the fog_, healing [[Dayne]] in body and soul. A **nat 20 speech** brought him back from the brink.
    

And then came the final duel.

**[[Alred]]’s demonic form** lunged with hatred. [[Dayne]] matched him blow for blow. As both teetered on the edge of death, **a dagger appeared in [[Alred]]’s gut—plunged not by a hand, but by will.**

The demon fell.

And in the quiet aftermath, [[Dayne]] saw his father—clear, proud, and vanishing.

> _“Find me, son. Come and find me.”_

[[Dayne]] _awoke_, reborn, surrounded by friends.

But the moment left no time for rest.

**[[Ciwin]] appeared**, holding the trembling form of the young elven boy—now crackling with unstable arcane energy. _The power had to go somewhere._ Before he could finish the sentence, **[[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] stepped forward**, without hesitation, and **absorbed the raw storm into himself.**

_And he changed._

Forever.

The deck quieted. You were not the same people who stepped onto that ship.

Then Galdore smiled faintly. _“I have a godson who could use your help.”_ He opened a portal—a shimmer of otherworldly light—and you glimpsed a **halfling barbarian**, mid-scream, **wrecking a bandit gang like a divine cannonball in leather armor.**

> _“Alright—he may not need your help... but it looks like you could use his.”_

### _Session 15: The Merchant, the Machine, and the Duel of Fate_

You began still aboard [[Galdore]]’s spectral vessel_, floating across the memory-stained waters of a sea that does not exist. The ancient druid explained why he exiled himself below the ice. His words turned toward older battles still shaping your path—**[[the Blood War]]**, that eternal, infernal conflict between Devils and Demons.

More unsettling still: [[Ciwin]] spoke of **[[Harold]]'s death**, and of _whispers from the mountains_. Rumors of a silent army of **machines**, hidden deep in the stone, waiting. Unblinking.

With answers (and more questions), you departed the ship through [[Galdore]]’s portal, finding yourselves back in the waking world.

---

### _Enter: The Halfling_

You caught up with the **halfling barbarian** [[Jingles]]—not hard, as he was about as stealthy as a thunderclap. But before you could say much, a **wizard** among you cast a spell that caused the halfling to bolt.

Your pursuit was cut short by a **hobgoblin ambush**. The halfling fought beside you in the chaos, and—after a shared victory soaked in blood and banter—**chose to stay**.

_Friendship, forged through violence. The classic way._

---

### _The Deck of Many Futures_

Then, from nowhere and everywhere, a **traveling merchant** appeared. Smooth voice, crooked smile, gilded words. He offered **wondrous treasures**, each far beyond your means—**for a single draw** from his deck of fate.

One by one, you reached out.

- Some drew **gifts**—boons, blessings, perhaps curses cleverly disguised.
    
- Others weren’t so lucky.
    

And then, the wizard took his turn.

The card glowed with unnatural heat. A **summoning**—a **duelbound challenge from beyond the veil**. Time stilled. The air cracked.

A **foe from another plane** stepped forth, summoned by fate to settle the debt in blood.

> One spellcaster. One enemy. No help.  
> This is where we left it:  
> **A 1v1 fight to the death.**

### _Session 16: The Pillars of Trial and Fire_

You regrouped with **[[Orin]]**, the grizzled dwarf you first spotted on that rickety cart entering [[Sarthal]]—a man whose quiet steadiness belied a steel-forged past. The reunion felt tense but familiar, a brief moment of calm before the storm.

The group found themselves standing in a massive chamber, its scale humbling. **Four colossal pillars rose from the floor**, each etched with ancient runes glowing faintly with arcane power. Shadows flickered as the chamber’s firelight danced on the stone.

Between the pillars lay a daunting **moat of molten lava**, its heat washing over your skin like a living thing.

Orin’s voice, low and measured, broke the silence:  
_“This place... it’s no ordinary trial. Each pillar guards a secret, a test—only by passing them can we hope to proceed.”_

---

### The Four Trials

You knew from whispered legends and bitter experience what the pillars represented:

- **The Lava Moat**: A treacherous barrier of searing flame and flowing rock. Crossing it would require more than mere agility—perhaps magic, cunning, or sheer guts.
    
- **The Fiery Horn**: A mystical artifact said to call forth ancient power or awaken sleeping terrors. How to wield it? That was the question.
    
- **The Riddle Sand Room**: A chamber where time itself seemed to flow like grains of sand—each riddle a key, every misstep a punishment. Logic and wit would be your weapons here.
    
- **The Dragon Tomb**: The final resting place of a forgotten wyrm. The air smelled of ash and old bones. Disturbing this sanctum could awaken more than memories.
    

---

### Where We Pick Up

_The party stands at the threshold of these four ancient tests, the heat of the lava moat on one side, the eerie glow of the dragon’s tomb on the other, and the whispers of riddles and horn calls filling the air._

Orin eyes you all sharply, hands resting on the haft of his axe:  
_"Choose wisely, for each path shapes the fate of those who dare tread it. And not all who enter return whole."_

### Session 17 Summary — _The Dragons’ Trial and the Rise of Chaos_

The party found themselves in a vast chamber with two massive, freshly dug graves—evidence that powerful dragons had recently been resurrected and then vanished. As they explored, they noticed [[Orin]] growing weaker with every passing moment in this cursed place.

They entered a strange circular chamber after laying down their arms, where three colored stones forced each party member into maddening speech curses—testing their wits and patience. Solving the riddle allowed them to press onward.

In another trial, the group chose between sacrificing sight or hearing, which led them to a colossal sphinx guarding the next threshold. After besting the sphinx’s riddle, they confronted a powerful caster—revealed to be [[Harold]], presumed dead and the cultist leader known as [[The Shadow]]. The party defeated him, but not before he shattered a mystical glass vessel, releasing the spirit of an ancient elf who ominously declared that chaos would return.

The battle culminated with the arrival of an ancient [[black dragon]] smashing through a sealed door. [[Orin]] revealed his true power, wielding a spear and an awe-inspiring golden dragon-scale shield as he faced the beast. The spirit of the ancient elf merged with the [[black dragon]], proclaiming the end of order and the dawn of chaos before vanishing.

[[Orin]] then transformed into a colossal [[golden dragon]], clashing fiercely with the [[black dragon]]. The battle tore the building’s roof apart as the [[black dragon]] escaped, only to be joined in the sky by [[five more chromatic dragons]]—heralds of an impending age of chaos.

### Session 18 Summary — _Into the Badlands and the Siege of Sarthall_

After [[Orin]] fully revealed his [[golden dragon]] form and shared vital history about [[Karakos]] and the reborn dragons, he set off north to confront loyalists still backing [[the chromatic dragons]]. Meanwhile, [[Karlock]] used a new divine ability to probe deeper into [[King Ithrid]]’s secrets, uncovering tantalizing clues about the realm’s fragile power structure.

The party chose the quickest route to [[Sarthall]], cutting through the harsh, unforgiving [[Badlands]] for the first time. The land itself seemed alien and hostile—dunes shifting like a living beast—until suddenly a massive sandworm erupted from the earth, devouring an unseen target far off. The group barely escaped with their lives, a stark reminder that the [[Badlands]] were no place for the faint-hearted.

Arriving at [[Sarthall]], they bypassed city guards through a risky assault and a difficult climb over the walls. Inside, the party linked up with [[Cailin]], who appeared to be working covertly against the oppressive paladins dominating the city.

[[Cailin]] entrusted [[Dayne]] with a mysterious packet meant for distraction—but when crushed, it exploded, injuring several and mysteriously producing a fleeting, cryptic card. The ensuing battle with twelve paladins was brutal; [[Jingles]] emerged as the deadliest, but [[Callum]] nearly fell—saved only by [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s protective magic and swift healing.

The session closed amidst the chaos and aftermath of this fierce conflict.

### Session 19 Summary — _Chases, Caves, and Chains_

In the chaotic aftermath of the palace square battle, [[Jons]] appeared with options for the party’s next move—but [[Callum]] wasted no time, sprinting off with a call to regroup at the stables. What followed was a tense, desperate chase through the city streets.

Meanwhile, [[Dayne]] discovered a hidden path behind a dumpster—a secret dugout cavern that promised quick escape. But the hope for safety was short-lived: the group stumbled into a vast Kobold colony and were swiftly captured.

Hidden beneath [[Cailin]]’s stables, the rest of the party eavesdropped on a high-stakes encounter: a Harathan Paladin general named [[Surge Wolfsbane]] halted the fleeing crown, his brutal voice unmistakable to [[Callum]].

Meanwhile, [[Dayne]] was escorted by a mysterious, ancient white Kobold speaking common to a cavernous chamber. There, chained by enormous shackles, lay a [[colossal black dragon]], its cracked scales glowing with molten lava beneath.

And that’s where the session ended—on the edge of danger and revelation.

### Session 20 Summary — _Old Friends, Ancient Gods, and Shadowed Fate_

The party reunited with a familiar face, [[Red Grimm]]—the sharp-tongued owner of the Grimm family casino and a key figure in the [[Sarthall]] resistance. Tensions ran high as [[Jingles]] clashed with Redd, threatening and wounding him before [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] subdued [[Jingles]] with _hold person_. Just as chaos erupted, an assassin’s dart struck Redd, forcing the party to save their tenuous ally.

Underground, [[Dayne]] found himself drawn into a perilous encounter with [[Kurulmak]], an ancient god whose whispers echoed through [[Dayne]]’s mind—fixating on his broken, cursed blade. In a tense mental standoff, [[Dayne]] asserted his control, but the god’s fiery wrath consumed him, plunging him into darkness.

Back with the resistance in the sewers, [[Karlock]] sensed [[Dayne]]’s disappearance. [[Ciwin]] appeared, warning that [[Jons]] was captured and sentenced to hang in the city square, ramping up the urgency.

Meanwhile, [[Dayne]]’s soul drifted onto the deck of a hauntingly familiar ship—face-to-face with his father—dead, trapped in the shadowfell.

### Session 21 Recap — _Rescue, Ruin, and a Skull’s Challenge_

The party raced through the caverns near the [[Grimm Family Casino]] after [[Ciwin]]’s urgent warning: [[Jons]] was captured and sentenced to hang in the city square. Braving waves of paladins and the ruthless [[Garold Grimtower]], you fought fiercely to free three prisoners—one revealed to be the legendary [[Damathos]], who disappeared as quickly as he was saved, promising to return. The identity and fate of the third figure remain shadowed (Tucker to fill in).

Mid-battle, the palace tower shattered as a wyvern soared onto the roof, carrying a black-armored figure crowned with a horned helmet. Wretched monsters clawed up from the earth, turning the fight toward this dark menace. Just as all seemed lost, [[Ciwin]] clashed fiercely with the figure—revealed to be a lich version of the Shadow, more powerful than ever.

The party escaped the ensuing chaos, retreating to a tavern where a mysterious, milky-eyed dwarf whispered of a legendary mountain beneath [[Drens]] harboring a sleeping army of machines—the only hope against the hobgoblin siege.

As sleep settled, a sudden crash and burst of light jolted you awake. [[Karlock]]’s perception check triggered a wild magic surge, sending a magical shield and a broken sword glowing into the sky before vanishing with the scent of cedar and cigar smoke. Approaching the disturbance, your new ally [[Eoran]] encountered a talking skull that demanded, “Who the F are you?”

### Session 22 Recap — _Whispers in the Wild and Awakening Machines_

The session opened in the aftermath of a meteor-like crash—the talking skull [[Eoran]] discovered slammed into the ground at the tavern. After a morning spent shopping with a mysterious traveling merchant, the party pushed onward toward [[Drens]], chasing rumors of a dormant mechanical army left behind by a mad wizard.

On the road, a pillar of smoke marked a grim scene—fallen [[Haratha Paladin]]s, killed moments before your arrival. Among the bodies, a dead paladin’s hand clutched a strange necklace, its pull undeniable.

Suddenly, a mouse—[[Mathias]]—halted the party and introduced himself, backed by a cadre of armed woodland creatures. They fought alongside a man named [[Redfell]], leading the crusade against [[Garold Grimtower]] and his paladins. The revelation hit [[Callum]] hard: Redfell was his uncle, the man who raised him. Torn, [[Callum]] chose to stay with family, parting ways with the group—for now.

The necklace guided you toward a ravine where three hobgoblins lay in wait. [[Galvatross]]’s cunning unraveled their plans before the party struck, wiping them out. Digging deeper, you found a trapped robot, its chest cavity empty—until the necklace slid into place, sparking it back to life.

[[Cygnus]] discovered a hidden door within the cavern walls, leading into darkness. A scream echoed below; rushing in, you found worms devouring deep gnomes. After slaying one worm and sending the other fleeing, a grateful deep gnome led you to an abandoned duergar city, revealing the severed head of a malevolent machine—an ominous warning.

### Session 23 Recap — _Echoes of the Deep and the Trident’s Call_

You began deep within an abandoned duergar city, led there by a grateful deep gnome after slaying the ravenous cave worms. From the dark halls, you seized the corrupted necron-like machine head, a grim trophy of the machines’ twisted influence. The gnomes, in gratitude, gifted you strange artifacts—[[Karlock]] received a fireball necklace pulsating with latent energy, while [[Jingles]] was handed a curious doll that seemed oddly alive.

Pressing forward, you ventured deeper into the mechanical labyrinth, only to find the tunnels were alive themselves: massive mechanical worms with spinning maws tore relentlessly through stone and metal, their advance followed by swarms of patchwork beetles that scavenged and repaired the tunnels in eerie tandem.

The party came upon a yawning chasm—below it sprawled a wasteland of scrap and ruin. War of the Worlds–style massive mechanical walkers roamed the junkyard below, sorting and organizing the detritus of some long-forgotten war machine. Amidst the chaos, a blinking beacon atop a distant spire caught [[Galvatross]]’s sharp eye.

Crossing the chasm tested your resolve; [[Karlock]]’s near-fall sent a collective breath through the group, but everyone made it across safely. Ahead, sconce-like lights pulsed red whenever magic was sensed—an ominous warning of detection in this hostile place.

Suddenly, the ground shook violently as one of the massive worms burst through nearby, tearing the ceiling apart. The tunnels began collapsing, forcing a desperate sprint. At a fork, you chose the organic path over the mechanical, sliding uncontrollably down into a vast cavern with a deep underwater lake.

As you fell, [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s quick spellwork saved most of the party from plunging into the frigid water, though the massive electric serpent lurking below surely watched with hungry eyes. [[Eoran]], steady on his feet, caught [[Karlock]] before he could fall.

On the shore, strange fish-like humanoids clad in necron-esque armor awaited—[[Kuo-Toa]], survivors of ancient battles and enslaved to the machines. A towering statue and etched stones told of a hero bearing a trident who would come to free them. The[[ Kuo-Toa]] treated [[Eoran]] like a chosen one, seating him on a ceremonial chair and leading him to a sacred beached boat.

Inside, the leader presented a trident embedded in the wall. [[Eoran]] struggled to move it—until a faint, familiar scent of tobacco and cologne stirred in the air, and the trident floated free behind him, as if recognizing a kin.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party explored a nearby cavern adorned with ancient drawings, revealing the tragic history of the [[Kuo-Toa]]’s enslavement and hinting at a prophecy: a figure strikingly similar to [[Dayne]] would rise to lead these fish-folk in rebellion against the mechanical overlords.

Now armed with the trident, [[Eoran]] was urged by the[[ Kuo-Toa]] to enter the water. You all followed, guided by the massive electric serpent—the water opening before you like the threshold to a new chapter.

### Session 25 Recap — _The Crumbling Colossus and the Portal Beyond_

Welcome to Netherat!! Last session you followed your fish-people allies deeper underwater, chasing the [[necron]] threat. The fish you met earlier with a spear through his head approached [[Eoran]], speaking with a refined English accent. He told you that he and his people would hold the [[necron]] horde off as long as possible, but your best chance was to find the core of this place and shut down the corrupted machines. [[Cygnus]] suspects this is also where the wizard [[Eveus]] is hiding. You learned these [[Kuo-Toa]] serve someone named [[Zava]]—once the matron mother of the drow in this land, cast out by the gods after wreaking havoc on the mortal plane. Legend says she had one true love, and he loved her in return. Before parting, the spear-wounded fish gave both [[Eoran]] and [[Jingles]] a passionate kiss, with just the right amount of tongue.

The current carried you through a twisting tunnel before spitting you out into a massive underwater cavern lit by thousands of tiny glowing jellyfish. There you saw six ancient colossi hauling giant slabs of stone, slowly moving toward a pyramid at the cavern’s center. These earth-shapers, normally destined to collapse and become the land itself, have been trapped here far beyond their time by an unseen force.

At the pyramid’s base, you found a seventh colossus seated on a massive throne, crowned with seaweed but unmoving. Jingles’s hammer pulsed, urging him forward toward the colossal belt the colossus wore. The belt was a ruby-colored mirror, and in it Jingles saw his own reflection—seated on the throne, wielding a hammer alive with electric energy. When [[Jingles]] touched his hammer to the mirror, it shattered, cracking the stone. The colossi began to crumble, causing massive crushing damage as a [[giant aboleth]] rose from the rubble and attacked. You quickly defeated the creature and survived the collapsing stone. Jingles claimed the belt of giant strength, gaining power that surged through his hammer.

You chose to explore the pyramid further and found a portal at its peak. When [[Voros]] passed his staff through, it shattered, revealing the portal led to another plane. One at a time, you stepped through, each encountering strange trials and acquiring unique gifts.

Finally, you reached the surface of the cavern, where the water abruptly ended. Passing through, you were flipped upside down and landed on solid ground, surrounded by rows of motionless [[necrons]] in various states of metal decay, their eyes faintly glowing green.
### Session 26 Recap — _The Core, the Dragon, and the Riddles of Dartanian_

You opened on a long, narrow bridge suspended above the mechanical graveyard, the ground below littered with decaying necron skeletons, silent sentinels of a forgotten war. The silence was eerie—these were no mere corpses but lingering echoes of corrupted constructs.

With careful precision, you navigated past the brittle remains and pressed on toward what you hoped was the core of this infernal machine fortress.

Your efforts brought you into a peculiar chamber: a raised central platform circled by four smaller ones, an imposing door on the far side emblazoned with a giant eye symbol. This was no ordinary door, but the entrance to a trial — and a challenge that awaited you was nothing less than a **[[mechanical dragon]]** of terrifying repute.

The battle was fierce and tactical. This was no simple beast, but a crafted guardian, presumably one of many traps designed to protect the wizard [[Eveus]]’s secrets. The dragon’s metallic scales shimmered with menace as it lashed out, its attacks blending brute force with arcane machinery.

Ultimately, the party triumphed, and Jingles claimed the dragon’s core—an organ-like artifact, pulsating with an eerie energy, likely the heart powering the beast’s relentless fury.

Pressing forward, you entered the inner sanctum—[[Cygnus]]’s knowledge revealing it to be his late master’s office, a place dense with arcane secrets and mechanical wonders. The tension of battle was replaced by eerie stillness, save for the quiet testament of the wizard’s demise.

Among the treasures was a **bronze staff** resting on the throne, alongside several intriguing pieces of gear that hinted at the wizard’s past power and technological mastery.

But before gaining full access to the knowledge held within, you faced **[[Dartanian]]**, the owl guardian bound to the master’s will. This was no mere animal but an intelligent sentinel who demanded passage through a series of riddles—enigmatic puzzles testing your wits and resolve.

Passing these tests, you were granted the wizard’s journal. Its pages detailed a desperate plan: to stop the necron corruption by shutting down their core systems—but with a twist. The plan involved overriding the existing controls to maintain access to the **mk 1 bots**, presumably less corrupted or even salvageable for your own ends.

To do this, you would need to secure **three additional cores** to join the one Jingles had acquired. Only by gathering and syncing all four could the system be overridden safely.

[[Cygnus]], enhanced with newly acquired upgrades, now sports a heads-up display (HUD) interface—a technological boon allowing him to hack, navigate, and extract data from the wizard’s archives with unprecedented ease.

Seizing the opportunity, you jumped aboard a flying beetle and descended into the scrapyard’s depths. At the bottom, as you pursued the beacon pinged on [[Cygnus]]’s map, you found yourselves stalked by **circular-jawed sharks**—mechanical predators designed to chew scrap and fuel the maze’s relentless growth.

Escaping the jaws of these relentless hunters, you reached a towering mound of scrap—the beacon’s location. But just as you approached, the mound came alive, transforming into a giant scrap monster bristling with blades and saws. You found yourselves standing atop, clutching for balance on this living nightmare of recycled destruction.

### Session 28 Recap — _The Spider Queen’s Gift & The Matrix Beholder Showdown_

You began the session still riding the momentum from atop the defeated scrap monster, its mechanical carcass fizzing with unstable energy before exploding in a fiery shockwave. You barely escaped the ensuing sinkhole collapse, plunging into a dark, comb-like labyrinth coated with viscous, web-like strands—an unsettling maze that felt alive and watchful.

As you scattered across different levels of the maze, mechanical spiders emerged—sleek, merciless, and clearly designed to defend this twisted nest. You fought fiercely, protecting your unconscious allies while navigating this sticky underworld.

Eventually, your path led to a giant spider’s lair—a cavernous nest pulsing with hundreds of metallic spider eggs, an eerie fusion of organic and machine. The air thickened with tension as a massive spider queen descended—ominous yet strangely serene.

Thanks to [[Cygnus]]’s insight, you discerned the queen’s true intent: she meant no harm, but rather a warning. She guided you toward a single, anomalous organic egg standing apart from the cold metallic masses. You claimed the third beacon nestled beside this unique egg—and, after some hesitation, took the organic egg as well, sensing its importance despite the unsettling nature of your discovery.

Seeking refuge and respite, your group ventured deeper, weary but determined. Soon the fourth beacon pinged rapidly—approaching fast from around a bend. The armor pieces scattered ahead bore familiar signs—fragments of necron tech, but worn by none other than your Kuo-Toa allies. Battle-hardened and armored in scavenged steel, they delivered the final beacon cell to you, proving their valor and resilience.

You seized this moment to long rest and resupply, grateful for the calm before the storm.

Returning to the mad wizard [[Eveus]]’s study, the atmosphere shifted: the entrance was eerily ajar, signaling danger. Within, an uncanny apparition flickered—a [[beholder]] made not of flesh but cascading lines of matrix-like data, its voice a cold AI whisper directly inside your minds.

This digital menace offered a tempting bargain: leave now, spare the corrupted machine’s core, and walk away with the mk.1 mech army intact—and, cryptically, reclaim something lost. The scent of tobacco filled the air, hinting at past betrayals and personal stakes.

Unwavering, you refused the offer, initiating a brutal showdown. The fight was chaotic—magic and glitching tech warping reality itself. In a wild twist, Eoran and the legendary Dayne swapped places through some arcane glitch tied to Shadowfell’s dark magic.

Dayne’s return turned the tide, pushing you to victory, but not without cost—[[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] was struck down, unconscious from the beholder’s deadly death ray.

### Session 29 Recap — _The Death of Voro, Cygnus Ascends, and the Battle of Drens Begins_

You pick up immediately after the brutal battle with the mechanical beholder. With the cores reset, the underground, living machine ecosystem is purged of corruption—a hard-fought victory. But this victory came at a great cost.

[[Cygnus]], recognizing that the system needs a guardian to prevent future corruption, integrates himself into the machinery. He becomes the new mainframe, the heart and mind controlling the vast ecosystem of [[Netherat]]—a transformation that is both awe-inspiring and fraught with potential consequences. This move puts a literal soul into the machine, but what price might that exact on Cygnus’s own autonomy?

Meanwhile, the party mourns the loss of [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]. Despite healing attempts, [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s life slips away, leaving a heavy silence. The emotional weight is palpable: [[Dayne]] claims [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s spellbook, a symbolic passing of knowledge and power, while [[Gal]] takes a mysterious magical orb clasped in [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s hand—an object of unknown potential that promises future narrative threads.

The mechanical beetles descend, their cold efficiency creating a massive pyramid entombing [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]—an eerie, almost reverent memorial to their fallen companion. But the destruction of the area reveals the prize you’ve been hunting: the mk.1 mechanical army, dormant no longer. Hundreds of these machines awaken and march out on a ramp built from the surrounding debris, under [[Cygnus]]’s command, poised to fight in the looming war outside [[Drens]].

[[Karlock]], drawn to [[Cygnus]]’s shell, claims his head, which transforms into a helmet—another artifact, another trophy steeped in significance.

[[Jingles]] notices a large symbol etched onto the pyramid’s side, seemingly meant as a message or warning from [[Cygnus]]. This symbol, mysterious and powerful, is surely a key to something deeper in the story, perhaps a clue to [[Cygnus]]’s transformation or future intentions.

The party emerges on a bluff overlooking the valley below [[Drens]], where the massive hobgoblin army waits, a chilling sight reminiscent of Helm’s Deep. The mechanical army lines up behind you, ready to follow your commands.

[[Jingles]] leads the charge, leaping off the cliff with the mechanical army thunderously behind. [[Gal]], mid-air, transforms a mech into a set of giant metallic wings, soaring alongside the assault. [[Karlock]] remains on the bluff, confronting a powerful hobgoblin commander—his victory brutal and merciless, tossing the foe’s corpse off the cliff without hesitation, a rare display of ruthless efficiency.

As the battle rages, the tide turns. The [[Drens]] dwarfs, inspired by the mechanical army’s arrival, push forward from the city walls with renewed vigor. But then the battlefield shifts ominously—the [[hobgoblin]] forces respond to a [[massive dragon]] looming overhead. The beast is unmistakably one of the [[Seven Karakos]], the legendary [[Chaos]] Reincarnated, a force of apocalyptic power and destruction.

The party locks eyes with the dragon in combat. [[Karlock]], isolated on a ledge above the fray, faces the beast alone. The encounter is tense and desperate.

**And then, the cliffhanger:** the dragon is stunned, hurtling 90 feet through the air—an image frozen in time.

### **Session 30 — “Those Who Plant Trees”**

The battle with the second dragon-horcrux of **[[Karakos]] ([[Chaos]])** was in full swing as two new warriors joined the fray: **[[Wyll Overview]]**, a stoic Human Paladin bearing the weight of old oaths, and **[[Dirge]]**, a Dragonborn Warlock with a hunger for truth and power. Dirge opened his journey with a natural 20—an omen of things to come.

The party brought down the dragon, with [[Dirge]] delivering the final blow. As the creature died, a rune bearing its symbol seared itself into [[Dirge]]’s blade—a mark of something deeper and more dangerous awakening.

With the dragon’s fall, the hobgoblin ranks shattered. The tide of war turned.

After the dust settled, [[Wyll Overview]] honored the fallen, and **[[Karlock]]** had his long-awaited reunion with **[[Dayne]]**. But the moment turned grim—[[Dayne]]’s arm, stretched out, looked withered and dead. [[Karlock]] could do nothing to help.

**[[Cygnus]]**, now fully integrated with the underground machine-city and its mech army, appeared before you in a pristine, digital form—eerily resembling a young Jude Law. His cryptic farewell hung heavy in the air:

> _“Those who plant trees never receive the shade they bring.”_  
> _“I have to tend the garden now, but I will see you again.”_

As a final twist, players were offered a chance to draw from a deck of mysterious gifts. [[Karlock]], of course, drew from the **Deck of Many Things**—and was engulfed in a pillar of infernal fire.

There, he faced **[[Karlock's Devil|The Devil]]** once more—the one who had first appeared after the gnome bard’s execution long ago. The devil revealed **[[Karakos]]’s true aim**: to tilt [[The Blood War]] in favor of the demons, unseating the [[Nine Hells]] and claiming dominion over all realms.

A deal was struck.

> _“If you need me, I will be there. If I call, you will answer.”_  
> [[Karlock]] agreed. The flames vanished. So did he.

Not long after, a column of elite dwarves in shining gold plate arrived—riding war-goats and led by **[[Bozmirra]]**, a noble warrior who invited the party into **[[Drens]]**, the mountain city they had just saved.

Inside the throne room, two thrones stood: one occupied by a young, elegant dwarf prince—clearly displeased with your presence—and the other claimed by [[Bozmirra]]. The prince offered cold civility before retreating behind chamber doors with his entourage. [[Bozmirra]], warm and sincere, promised to speak again soon and followed after him.

Left alone, **[[Dayne]]** couldn’t resist. The prince’s chamber door had been left slightly ajar. Inside, on a cluttered desk, [[Dayne]] found a sealed scroll with a strange mark. Reaching for it, he triggered a magical alarm—an enchanted skull letting out a wailing shriek through the royal hall.

### **Session 31 — “The King of Giants & the Fall Court Trials”**

Still inside the **throne room of [[Drens]]**, things took a turn when **[[Dayne]]**, ever curious, snuck into the chambers of the petulant dwarven prince. He disturbed an object on the prince’s desk—triggering a trap that phased him into an **alternate dimension**, unseen and unreachable by the rest of the party.

The rest of you worked quickly to solve the puzzle: a **talking skull**, a **bug-shaped quill**, and an **enchanted ink well**. After a few flubbed attempts (and some chaos), the trap was finally broken and [[Dayne]] returned, just as an old, robed dwarf was escorted into the hall.

The man turned out to be no threat—in fact, he was the **father of the royal twins**, and surprisingly chill. Karlock questioned him about a mysterious **green gemstone** with a fiery center. The old king revealed it was a portal key—one that would open a rift to **[[Ciwin]]’s prison**.

Meanwhile, **[[Jingles]]**, increasingly smitten with the dwarven princess, tried to win her father's favor. The old king spoke of a **[[prophecy]]**: a true **[[King of Giants]]** would reunite their shattered race and bring peace—but only if they could recover three legendary relics:

- _The Hammer of Thunderbolts_
    
- _The Belt of Giant Strength_
    
- _The Gauntlets of Ogre Power_
    

Moved by something unspoken, the king embraced [[Jingles]] and discreetly slipped a **ring** into his pocket.

Then, without hesitation, he smashed the green gem—tearing open a portal—and the party stepped through.

You emerged in a **dungeon beneath a Feywild palace**, sneaking carefully through its winding halls. Overheard voices led you to a high balcony, where the **rulers of the four Feywild courts**—Spring, Summer, Winter, and Fall—argued bitterly. They blamed each other for the ongoing, unnatural **seasonal stagnation**, particularly the Winter Court's growing influence. The bickering lords exited to what appeared to be a stadium’s luxury box.

You followed.

Peering into the arena, you saw **three captives bound to poles**: a satyr, your old friend **[[Ciwin]]**, and **[[Natalie Portman]]**. The leader of the Fall Court addressed the crowd as a monstrous **giant toad** lumbered toward [[Ciwin]].

You had heard enough. The team **leapt into the arena**, shattering the rules of this macabre spectacle and triggering a full-blown battle. During the fight, something—perhaps one of your strikes or spells—**disabled the forcefield** enclosing the palace. The audience went wild.

You defeated the frog monster… but not without loss: **[[Natalie Portman]] was swallowed whole**, disappearing into the belly of the beast.

Just as the Fall Court leader tried to rein in the chaos and address you, a **troll—launched like a catapult round—**hurtled through the air and smashed directly into the luxury box, splattering the Fall Court ruler across the stone**.

The crowd roared again—but not in celebration.  
This wasn’t over.
### **Session 32 — “The Hourglass Shifts”**

Still deep in the Feywild, the party launched into a desperate rescue mission as **[[Ciwin]]**, a satyr named **[[Hank]]**, and **[[Natalie Portman]]** were chained in an arena, with a hulking **frog-beast** looming over them. **[[Jingles]]** leapt from the balcony into the pit, landing a brutal strike, while **[[Wyll Overview]]** and **[[Gal]]** faced the four Eladrin leaders above.

The battle split in two. Below, **[[Karlock]]** banished [[Ciwin]] to the Material Plane mid-combat to protect him. [[Natalie Portman]] wasn’t so lucky—she was swallowed by the beast, and though you eventually brought it down, she died. Her body was expelled, and the party claimed the **Necklace of Adaptation** from her remains.

On the balcony, tension rose as the **[[Fall Eladrin]]** tried to calm the crowd. Suddenly, a **massive troll** crashed down onto him, **instantly killing him**. Chaos erupted. Trolls began **raining down** into the palace—**a full-scale siege** had begun.

Aboard a summoned griffon, [[Wyll Overview]] lifted allies to the balcony as the battle intensified. You witnessed the **[[Summer Eladrin]]'s throat slit by a troll**, their body flickering and transforming into a **lifeless mannequin**. The **[[Spring Eladrin]]** panicked and fled deeper into the palace.

**[[Ciwin]]**, now fully alert and dead serious, urged pursuit. You split up, chasing the [[Spring Eladrin]] through twisting fey corridors that mocked reason and logic. One group became trapped in a **cylindrical aquarium**, sharks circling below. A clever puzzle-solving escape brought them to an empty room—safe, but lost.

Meanwhile, the second group encountered **illusory doors**—each personalized, whispering temptations. All resisted the enchantments…except **[[Dayne]]**, who stepped through a portal into his past.

He stood again aboard his father’s ship in the **[[Shadowfell]]**, where a hooded figure (his father?) stood facing away. The figure turned, shushed him with a finger, and pointed upward. There, spreading its wings before a fake, pale moon, was the unmistakable wraith-form of **[[Karakos]]—[[Chaos]] incarnate**. Dread took hold before [[Dayne]] was yanked back into the Feywild.

When he returned, his friends had already subdued the **[[Spring Eladrin]]**, who also flickered into a mannequin upon defeat.

Reunited with [[Ciwin]] in a courtyard under siege, your escape was nearly blocked. **Gigantic chunks of the palace were being torn into the sky**, levitating toward some unseen force. [[Ciwin]], eyes wide, whispered in reverent terror:

> _“He’s here.”_

A **[[colossal wind dragon]]**, swirling with violent storm magic, descended through the clouds—**one of the Seven**, the avatar of **Air itself**. Its first breath attack made it clear: this wasn’t a fight you could win.

[[Ciwin]] cast a **wall of force**, giving you moments to act. A shattered **crystal** opened a rift home—your only exit.

You stumbled back into **[[Netherat]]**… but not the one you left.

The ancient elven ruins from your earliest adventures were still there—but no longer buried beneath trees and vines. Now, they stood alone in the middle of a vast **desert wasteland**. Time had passed. **A lot of it.**

The Feywild's strange clock had shifted reality itself.

### **Session 34 — “The Kraken, the Pact, and the Falling Star”**

_Welcome back to Netherat… or what’s left of it._

The battle against the **[[kraken]]** was over, but its monstrous corpse still steamed on the battlefield—a carcass hiding more than just rot.

**[[Wyll Overview]]**, having been swallowed during the fight, emerged from the beast’s belly. Inside, he had seen **a vision**: his brother **[[Michael]]**, wounded and dying, and beside him, a radiant **sword pulsing with divine light**. The inner walls of the kraken were etched with an unnatural **map of stars**, constellations stitched into flesh.

Elsewhere, **[[Ciwin]]** discovered a truth more dangerous than any relic: **[[Karlock]] had struck a pact with a devil**—a secret he had kept from the party. Tensions rose. **[[Dayne]]** and **[[Gal]]**, trying to understand the source of [[Karlock]]’s fear of the holy sword [[Wyll Overview]] had seen, found themselves suddenly **bound into the same infernal contract**. No choice. No escape. Their souls now _linked_ to [[Karlock]]’s deal.

At the same time, **[[Jingles]]** followed a strange pull through the ruins and found a prisoner: a **[[dragon trapped in human form]]**, its chest glowing with the same **star pattern** seen inside the [[kraken]]. The implications were staggering—something ancient and celestial was unfolding around them, older than gods, older than devils.

Then came **[[Grawl]]**, war leader of the orcs, appearing in the box of the arena. He addressed Jingles directly:

> “Come to **[[Anguis]]**.”

But whatever diplomacy he hoped for was shattered when he turned and **punched [[Karlock]] in the jaw**, hard and fast. The room froze.

The **orc alliance** was gone—splintered by mistrust, secrets, and the stink of devil’s flame. Whatever peace you had brokered with them was now dust.
### Session 36 — “The Dragon’s Judgment”**

The city of [[Anguis]] trembles beneath the weight of rising tension. After [[Jingles]]’ stunning victory over the [[balgura]] in the pit, applause fades into uneasy silence as darker forces stir beneath the surface.

[[Dayne]] and [[Gal]] remain bound to [[Karlock]]’s devilish pact, their fates tethered to infernal chains that shadow every choice. Meanwhile, [[Jingles]] is drawn through [[Anguis]]’s winding corridors to a caged figure—**[[Sylen, the Platinum Dragon]]**, trapped in human form.

With unsettling calm, [[Sylen, the Platinum Dragon|Sylen]] frees himself and unlocks a searing vision in [[Jingles]]’ mind: a young [[Jingles]] witnessing his tribe’s massacre, [[a silver dragon]] bursting forth in a blaze of light and fury. The memory crashes over him like thunder.

Before disappearing in a swirl of silver mist, [[Sylen, the Platinum Dragon]]
brutally dispatches two orc guards—making [[Jingles]] and [[Gal]] wanted for murder.

Suddenly, the city’s alarms wail as a **massive [[gold dragon]]—[[Orin]]—descends**, casting a shadow over the battlements. His eyes burn with unyielding purpose.

You manage to hold the beast’s fury at bay, but [[Orin]]’s message is clear: trust is broken, and earning it back will come at a steep price.

With wings spread wide and chest glowing like molten metal, [[Orin]] prepares to put on a show that will decide your fate in [[Anguis]]—and perhaps beyond.
