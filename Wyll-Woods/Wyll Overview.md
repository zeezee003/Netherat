## initial Notes
Wyll Woods, Paladin Oath of the Crown, a loyal servant of Sarthal. However, recently he has felt the unrest in his city. His sacred oath is to protect the Sarthal and the ideals if was founded on. His suspicions first arose when Jons disappeared from the Guard, in which Wyll has faithfully served as a keeper of the peace. Between Jons disappearing, the Harartha Paladins taking control, the strange goings on with the sudden appearance of the King… has driven Wyll to not question his Oath, but rather if it was time to keep it and protect Sarthal from these outsiders. To protect the King. To protect the Crown. To protect and preserve justice.

Where was he born?
- Sarthal outer city  
Where does he live now?
- Sarthal - Barracks    
Who are those close to him?
Why did he volunteer?
- To serve his city
Why did he get promoted to City Guard?
If not in Sarthal why did he leave?
What does he value the most?
- Justice     
- Honor  
- The Law    
What does he think of the Haratha Paladins?
-  N/A 
What does he think of Jons?
- Respect
What does he think of Ciwin?
- Caution 
What does he know about the siege of Drens?
- This all depends. How public is this knowledge in Sarthal?
What does he think of Redd Grimm, and that family?
- I think he hates them with all his being. He sees them as a threat to order in Sarthal.
- I'm sure he’s even arrested one of them before. But the chargers didn’t stick… they never do.

## Notes From Jake Before First Session

- The palace district is safe for Wyll. This is where the Paladins are help up in. The Party is not welcome. The District is walled in.

- Chaos resurrecting Demons and Monsters. Zealots are just pawns.
	- Shadow is serving Chaos. Shadow took the out to survive but now serves Chaos

- Our city filled with monsters. Undead monsters wreaking havoc in the city. These are separate from the Demons and Zealots.
	- Haratha Paladins fighting against them. They are losing the war.

- Still haven’t seen the King since that one day.

- A single figure has taken the palace for themselves. Leader of the paladins. Idk who it is.  Surge is what he is known by.

- Wyll left to hunt and kill demons with a full battalion. Took those who were loyal to the city once Jon’s left I became the one in control. Find Jon’s. Keep people safe.

- Found signs of a dragon in the hills. Me and my men are staying at a dwarves village. 
	- Dwarven city - Steelhaven. This is where we've been holding up in the mean time. We can make camp there quite safely.

- We got caught up in the battle.

## Raw Campaign Notes:

We found that ciwin was trapped in the feywild after we had last seen him after the TimeStop with lich version of karakos.

40 year time jump in Sarthal after coming back from the feywild. Jons is now the king.

the shadow was the leader of the cult
Chaos = Karakos -> Goal turn the tide of the blood wars. He wants to take over the Nine. hence bringing up old dead monsters i.e bone dragon, kraken, aboleth.. he's still going around bringing up these monsters. its also happening on other planes. 

his sources of power are these dragons. 7 dragons. we've killed three. last time we found the platinum dragon who framed jingles for murder. Orcs not trusting us. 

the Orcs are trying to defend against Orin (gold dragon). We need to help them "fight off" Orin to hopefully regain trust.

Ok so how did Orin survive the Dragon Wars.
The dragon wars ended about 150 years ago. Legend has it that **all** the dragons died as a result.. 
There's something Orin isn't telling us.

This is the first time Wyll has seen a dragon.. ever. *He's panicked!*

## [[Session 37]]
# Personal Notes
- Wyll is confused as to why his necklace spoke to him again. This hasn't happened in over 20 years. Why now?
- Why did it lead him to his lost brother Michael? How did Michael seem to know about [[Dawnbringer]]?
- Why did the necklace fuse to his chest *Tony Stark style?*
- What or Who is on the other end of this necklace? Is the necklace sentient? 
- Wyll knows his madidate is to protect his newly found friends.. but why?
- What great purpose if any is there to all this? Is Wyll a pawn in some game?
