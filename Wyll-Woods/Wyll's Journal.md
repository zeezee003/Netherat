# Wyllâ€™s Journal:

**Journal Entry 1:**
Date: [Wyll's 16th birthday]

*Today, I took my first step toward my destiny. Father enrolled me in the City Guard's training program, and I swore my oaths as a Paladin of the Crown. My heart is filled with pride, for I have chosen the path of honor, justice, and loyalty. I'll do my family proud and protect Sarthal with unwavering determination.*

**Journal Entry 2:**
Date: [A few years later]
*Training has been grueling, but I am becoming a formidable warrior. The law courses through my veins, and my skills with a sword are unmatched. I am driven to uphold the law and bring justice to those who defy it.* 

**Journal Entry 3:**
Date: [Promotion day]
*Today, I received my first promotion in the City Guard. I am now an Inspector, tasked with solving complex cases and upholding the values of Sarthal. Father would have been proud; he always said I had the makings of a great protector of our city.*

**Journal Entry 4:**
Date: [Mention a recent case Wyll solved]
*A robbery in the merchant district was thwarted thanks to my quick thinking and determination. Justice was served, and the guilty party is behind bars. Sarthal is a safer place with every criminal I bring to justice.*

**Journal Entry 5:**
Date: [The day Jons disappeared]
*Jons, my mentor and a pillar of the Guard, has disappeared without a trace. My heart aches, and I fear for his safety. This city is changing, and not for the better. The rise of the Harartha Paladins is unsettling, and I sense something dark lurking beneath the surface.*

**Journal Entry 6:**
Date: [The day he first met Ciwin]
*Today, I encountered Ciwin, an enigmatic figure with knowledge about the city's secrets. I approached him with caution, for he holds answers that could unravel the mysteries shrouding Sarthal. His motives remain unclear, but I must tread carefully in these uncertain times.*
  
**Journal Entry 7:**
Date: [Reflection on the siege of Drens, mention if it's public knowledge]
*The siege of Drens, a shadowy event, looms over Sarthal. The details are kept hidden, known only to a select few. The whispers suggest that our city holds secrets darker than we could imagine. I am determined to uncover the truth, no matter how well it is concealed.*

**Journal Entry 8:**
Date: [Recent encounter with a member of the Redd Grimm family]
*Once again, I crossed paths with a member of the vile Redd Grimm family. I arrested one of them, but, as always, the charges didn't stick. They elude justice, and my hatred for them grows with each encounter. They are a threat to the order of Sarthal, and they will be held accountable.*

**Journal Entry 9:**
Date: [Preparation for departure to the city of Drens]
*I stand at a crossroads, my duty to Sarthal pulling me in conflicting directions. The city is in turmoil, and I feel compelled to leave for the city of Drens, seeking answers and perhaps allies to protect Sarthal from the shadows that encroach upon it. I go with the words of my oath echoing in my mind, for justice, honor, and loyalty guide my path. Sarthal, I shall return to protect you.*

**Journal Entry 10:**
Date: [Arrival in Drens]
*My god. They're everywhere. We can make safe camp in Steelhaven. But we must make short work of these hobgoblins, for the sake of this tribe.*
