### _Session 12: Fortress of Feathers and Blood_

_Steel sang on black wings._

Last session opened at the base of a **fortress carved into the jagged cliffs**—a crude, weather-beaten stronghold belonging to the **Kenku**, those mimic-voiced scavengers who speak only in echoes of the dead.

Your party stormed the keep in a full assault, blades drawn, spells loosed. **The battle was brutal**, the Kenku fighting with erratic precision, ambushing from the shadows, shrieking in a chorus of stolen phrases. One of them echoed words _you_ had said earlier—_someone's been listening._

You fought your way through rusted gates and narrow halls, smoke filling your lungs as feathers littered the floor like snow. The enemy was clever, coordinated—but not clever enough.

By the time the dust settled, the Kenku lay broken, and their fortress lay quiet.
