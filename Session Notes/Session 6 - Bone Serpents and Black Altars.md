### _Session 6: Bone Serpents and Black Altars_

The stink of rot thickened as the party pushed deeper into the sewers. At a fork in the path, [[Galvatross]] closed his eyes, divine sense radiating outward like a ripple through tainted water. He turned left—undead lingered there. The party followed.

They found the last ghoul from their earlier skirmish, still lurking in the shadows. It didn’t last long. A flash of steel and spell dropped it where it stood. The group pocketed a modest stash of coin from the remains before doubling back to explore the other route.

That path led to a chamber—large, echoing, flickering with torchlight. A stone altar stood at its center, and five robed zealots surrounded it, chanting feverishly, their eyes wild with madness.

[[Galvatross]] cloaked the party in shadow and silence with _Pass Without Trace_. They crept forward unseen, breath held, blades ready. But before they could strike, the lead cultist drove a dagger into his own chest, screaming a final phrase as blood splattered across the altar.

The stone shook. From the depths of the sewer, something _answered_.

A [[colossal skeletal serpent]] erupted from the ground, bones grinding and magic humming between its ribs. The room exploded into chaos.

[[Callum]] dropped one zealot with a clean, concussive strike—alive, but unconscious. A prisoner for [[Ciwin]]. [[Dayne]] was nearly taken down, paralyzed by the beast’s necrotic venom, his fate hanging by a thread until [[Karlock]] intervened, casting _Lesser Restoration_ just in time.

The tide turned.

[[Voro]] unleashed a hail of damage, wearing the creature down piece by piece. And then, with divine light arcing off his blade, [[Callum]] smote the beast into dust, bones shattering in a radiant blast.

The chamber fell still. One zealot remained, unconscious. The summoning had failed. But something worse now stirred in the deep.
