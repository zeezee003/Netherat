### _Session 10: Fire, Theft, and the Caged Child_

_Netherat's shadows run deep—even in daylight._

The session opened in the quiet coastal town of **[[Bellwood]]**, at a weathered tavern known as _[[The Book and the Blade]]_. [[Dayne]], brooding over his pirate’s cutlass, was struck by a sudden, jarring memory: his old companion [[Thag]], curious about the weapon, had once grasped it—only for it to sear his hands and pin him to the floor. [[Thag]] had snarled a warning: _"Get that thing out of here."_

Whatever this sword is, it’s _wrong_. It remembers too much.

After a long rest, the party stopped at **[[CDXX Herbs & Such]]**, where you met the mellow and suspiciously-named **[[Chandler Bong]]**. You shared a few jokes, earned his trust, and Dayne promptly robbed him. Old habits. New consequences.

Leaving [[Bellwood]] behind, your road curved toward the coast—until you crossed paths with a heavily armored group hauling a covered cart. Something was off. You followed at a distance as the group veered into the woods. When night fell, you struck.

Combat erupted in the dark, steel and spell colliding. These were no mere mercs. They were the **[[Sons of Embar]]**—fanatics devoted to purging magic. [[Callum]] was shackled with an _anti-magic manacle_, and [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] was nearly cut down in the skirmish.

When the dust settled and the Sons lay dead, you approached their cart. [[Callum]], his divine sense tingling, _felt something fey_. [[Dayne]] ripped off the sheet.

Inside: [[Eladrin Boy]]. Elven. Barely sixteen. Unconscious.

A prisoner of zealots. A mystery in flesh.
