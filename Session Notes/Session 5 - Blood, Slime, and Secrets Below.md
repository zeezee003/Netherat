### _Session 5: Blood, Slime, and Secrets Below_

The VIP lounge of the [[Grimm Family Casino]] pulsed with smoke, synth-jazz, and whispered deals. Among the lavish crowd, the party overheard a scuffle—a guard was shoving a stone-skinned Earth Genasi toward the exit. The man’s name was _[[Galvatross]]_, and his only crime was standing out. [[Callum]] stepped in, leveling his voice and his stance, and the party quickly made a new ally.

Winnings in hand, they finally met _[[Redd Grimm]]_—the silver-tongued patriarch of the Grimm brothers. He wore his charm like armor, his menace just beneath the smile. After some casual banter and a handshake that felt like a veiled threat, he handed them a sealed envelope. No explanation. No instructions. They haven’t opened it.

After a round of drinks (and [[Dayne]] enjoying the scenery a little too openly), the group remembered their purpose and descended into the city’s underbelly—the sewers [[Ciwin]] had marked.

The stink hit first, then the shadows. Barely into the tunnels, a shivering junkie named _[[Jake]]_ begged them to find his brother _[[Rob]]_. A few corridors later, they found him—too late. A ghoul was hunched over [[Rob]]’s shredded corpse, and two more joined as the party engaged.

The battle was swift and brutal. Steel rang, spells hissed, and the undead were put down—though one slinked off into the dark. The group, bloodied but intact, chose the risk of a rest in the filth.

It didn’t last.

They were jolted awake by the hungry slither of an ooze. Blinded by sleep and darkness, they scrambled to their feet and carved the thing apart in a messy, desperate fight.

The sewers weren’t just dangerous—they were _watching_. And something down there _knew_ they were coming.
