### Session 25 Recap — _The Crumbling Colossus and the Portal Beyond_

Welcome to Netherat!! Last session you followed your fish-people allies deeper underwater, chasing the [[necron]] threat. The fish you met earlier with a spear through his head approached [[Eoran]], speaking with a refined English accent. He told you that he and his people would hold the [[necron]] horde off as long as possible, but your best chance was to find the core of this place and shut down the corrupted machines. [[Cygnus]] suspects this is also where the wizard [[Eveus]] is hiding. You learned these [[Kuo-Toa]] serve someone named [[Zava]]—once the matron mother of the drow in this land, cast out by the gods after wreaking havoc on the mortal plane. Legend says she had one true love, and he loved her in return. Before parting, the spear-wounded fish gave both [[Eoran]] and [[Jingles]] a passionate kiss, with just the right amount of tongue.

The current carried you through a twisting tunnel before spitting you out into a massive underwater cavern lit by thousands of tiny glowing jellyfish. There you saw six ancient colossi hauling giant slabs of stone, slowly moving toward a pyramid at the cavern’s center. These earth-shapers, normally destined to collapse and become the land itself, have been trapped here far beyond their time by an unseen force.

At the pyramid’s base, you found a seventh colossus seated on a massive throne, crowned with seaweed but unmoving. Jingles’s hammer pulsed, urging him forward toward the colossal belt the colossus wore. The belt was a ruby-colored mirror, and in it Jingles saw his own reflection—seated on the throne, wielding a hammer alive with electric energy. When [[Jingles]] touched his hammer to the mirror, it shattered, cracking the stone. The colossi began to crumble, causing massive crushing damage as a [[giant aboleth]] rose from the rubble and attacked. You quickly defeated the creature and survived the collapsing stone. Jingles claimed the belt of giant strength, gaining power that surged through his hammer.

You chose to explore the pyramid further and found a portal at its peak. When [[Voros]] passed his staff through, it shattered, revealing the portal led to another plane. One at a time, you stepped through, each encountering strange trials and acquiring unique gifts.

Finally, you reached the surface of the cavern, where the water abruptly ended. Passing through, you were flipped upside down and landed on solid ground, surrounded by rows of motionless [[necrons]] in various states of metal decay, their eyes faintly glowing green.
