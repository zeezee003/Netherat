### Session 20 Summary — _Old Friends, Ancient Gods, and Shadowed Fate_

The party reunited with a familiar face, [[Red Grimm]]—the sharp-tongued owner of the Grimm family casino and a key figure in the [[Sarthall]] resistance. Tensions ran high as [[Jingles]] clashed with Redd, threatening and wounding him before [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] subdued [[Jingles]] with _hold person_. Just as chaos erupted, an assassin’s dart struck Redd, forcing the party to save their tenuous ally.

Underground, [[Dayne]] found himself drawn into a perilous encounter with [[Kurulmak]], an ancient god whose whispers echoed through [[Dayne]]’s mind—fixating on his broken, cursed blade. In a tense mental standoff, [[Dayne]] asserted his control, but the god’s fiery wrath consumed him, plunging him into darkness.

Back with the resistance in the sewers, [[Karlock]] sensed [[Dayne]]’s disappearance. [[Ciwin]] appeared, warning that [[Jons]] was captured and sentenced to hang in the city square, ramping up the urgency.

Meanwhile, [[Dayne]]’s soul drifted onto the deck of a hauntingly familiar ship—face-to-face with his father—dead, trapped in the shadowfell.
