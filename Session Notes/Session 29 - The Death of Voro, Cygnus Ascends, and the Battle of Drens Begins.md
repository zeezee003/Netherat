### Session 29 Recap — _The Death of Voro, Cygnus Ascends, and the Battle of Drens Begins_

You pick up immediately after the brutal battle with the mechanical beholder. With the cores reset, the underground, living machine ecosystem is purged of corruption—a hard-fought victory. But this victory came at a great cost.

[[Cygnus]], recognizing that the system needs a guardian to prevent future corruption, integrates himself into the machinery. He becomes the new mainframe, the heart and mind controlling the vast ecosystem of [[Netherat]]—a transformation that is both awe-inspiring and fraught with potential consequences. This move puts a literal soul into the machine, but what price might that exact on Cygnus’s own autonomy?

Meanwhile, the party mourns the loss of [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]. Despite healing attempts, [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s life slips away, leaving a heavy silence. The emotional weight is palpable: [[Dayne]] claims [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s spellbook, a symbolic passing of knowledge and power, while [[Gal]] takes a mysterious magical orb clasped in [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s hand—an object of unknown potential that promises future narrative threads.

The mechanical beetles descend, their cold efficiency creating a massive pyramid entombing [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]—an eerie, almost reverent memorial to their fallen companion. But the destruction of the area reveals the prize you’ve been hunting: the mk.1 mechanical army, dormant no longer. Hundreds of these machines awaken and march out on a ramp built from the surrounding debris, under [[Cygnus]]’s command, poised to fight in the looming war outside [[Drens]].

[[Karlock]], drawn to [[Cygnus]]’s shell, claims his head, which transforms into a helmet—another artifact, another trophy steeped in significance.

[[Jingles]] notices a large symbol etched onto the pyramid’s side, seemingly meant as a message or warning from [[Cygnus]]. This symbol, mysterious and powerful, is surely a key to something deeper in the story, perhaps a clue to [[Cygnus]]’s transformation or future intentions.

The party emerges on a bluff overlooking the valley below [[Drens]], where the massive hobgoblin army waits, a chilling sight reminiscent of Helm’s Deep. The mechanical army lines up behind you, ready to follow your commands.

[[Jingles]] leads the charge, leaping off the cliff with the mechanical army thunderously behind. [[Gal]], mid-air, transforms a mech into a set of giant metallic wings, soaring alongside the assault. [[Karlock]] remains on the bluff, confronting a powerful hobgoblin commander—his victory brutal and merciless, tossing the foe’s corpse off the cliff without hesitation, a rare display of ruthless efficiency.

As the battle rages, the tide turns. The [[Drens]] dwarfs, inspired by the mechanical army’s arrival, push forward from the city walls with renewed vigor. But then the battlefield shifts ominously—the [[hobgoblin]] forces respond to a [[massive dragon]] looming overhead. The beast is unmistakably one of the [[Seven Karakos]], the legendary [[Chaos]] Reincarnated, a force of apocalyptic power and destruction.

The party locks eyes with the dragon in combat. [[Karlock]], isolated on a ledge above the fray, faces the beast alone. The encounter is tense and desperate.

**And then, the cliffhanger:** the dragon is stunned, hurtling 90 feet through the air—an image frozen in time.
