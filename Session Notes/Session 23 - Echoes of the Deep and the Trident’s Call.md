### Session 23 Recap — _Echoes of the Deep and the Trident’s Call_

You began deep within an abandoned duergar city, led there by a grateful deep gnome after slaying the ravenous cave worms. From the dark halls, you seized the corrupted necron-like machine head, a grim trophy of the machines’ twisted influence. The gnomes, in gratitude, gifted you strange artifacts—[[Karlock]] received a fireball necklace pulsating with latent energy, while [[Jingles]] was handed a curious doll that seemed oddly alive.

Pressing forward, you ventured deeper into the mechanical labyrinth, only to find the tunnels were alive themselves: massive mechanical worms with spinning maws tore relentlessly through stone and metal, their advance followed by swarms of patchwork beetles that scavenged and repaired the tunnels in eerie tandem.

The party came upon a yawning chasm—below it sprawled a wasteland of scrap and ruin. War of the Worlds–style massive mechanical walkers roamed the junkyard below, sorting and organizing the detritus of some long-forgotten war machine. Amidst the chaos, a blinking beacon atop a distant spire caught [[Galvatross]]’s sharp eye.

Crossing the chasm tested your resolve; [[Karlock]]’s near-fall sent a collective breath through the group, but everyone made it across safely. Ahead, sconce-like lights pulsed red whenever magic was sensed—an ominous warning of detection in this hostile place.

Suddenly, the ground shook violently as one of the massive worms burst through nearby, tearing the ceiling apart. The tunnels began collapsing, forcing a desperate sprint. At a fork, you chose the organic path over the mechanical, sliding uncontrollably down into a vast cavern with a deep underwater lake.

As you fell, [[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]]’s quick spellwork saved most of the party from plunging into the frigid water, though the massive electric serpent lurking below surely watched with hungry eyes. [[Eoran]], steady on his feet, caught [[Karlock]] before he could fall.

On the shore, strange fish-like humanoids clad in necron-esque armor awaited—[[Kuo-Toa]], survivors of ancient battles and enslaved to the machines. A towering statue and etched stones told of a hero bearing a trident who would come to free them. The[[ Kuo-Toa]] treated [[Eoran]] like a chosen one, seating him on a ceremonial chair and leading him to a sacred beached boat.

Inside, the leader presented a trident embedded in the wall. [[Eoran]] struggled to move it—until a faint, familiar scent of tobacco and cologne stirred in the air, and the trident floated free behind him, as if recognizing a kin.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party explored a nearby cavern adorned with ancient drawings, revealing the tragic history of the [[Kuo-Toa]]’s enslavement and hinting at a prophecy: a figure strikingly similar to [[Dayne]] would rise to lead these fish-folk in rebellion against the mechanical overlords.

Now armed with the trident, [[Eoran]] was urged by the[[ Kuo-Toa]] to enter the water. You all followed, guided by the massive electric serpent—the water opening before you like the threshold to a new chapter.
