### _Session 7: Songs in the Sewer and Secrets on the Coast_

The bone serpent lay shattered, and the party emerged from the sewers with blood on their boots and questions in their pockets. They split up—two went to answer [[Redd Grimm]]’s summons, the others to report back to [[Ciwin]] with the captured zealot.

**[[Voro]] and [[Callum]]**, ever the loyal lackeys (and somehow forgetful), showed up at Redd’s estate empty of context. They hadn’t read the sealed letter he gave them. After some awkward small talk with the crime boss—whose smile always seems like it’s daring you to betray him—they slipped out and cracked the letter open. It instructed them to visit a tavern called _[[Rapscallion’s]]_.

Meanwhile, **[[Dayne]], [[Galvatross]], and [[Karlock]]** delivered the unconscious zealot to [[Ciwin]]. They found him in the company of high-ranking soldiers—strange men not from [[Sarthall]], wearing the kind of armor that looks ceremonial until you see the bloodstains. [[Ciwin]] praised their efforts, confirmed that similar altars had been reported near the coast, and rewarded [[Karlock]] with a _Wand of Healing_—a rare and potent gift.

The party reunited and went to _[[Rapscallion’s]]_, playing along with the coded instructions. A secret drink. A hidden message. The phrase they deciphered?

**“Kill the Bard Gnome.”**

And sure enough, the night’s entertainment was a gnome plucking away on a lute, singing to a room that had no idea it was witnessing his final set.

You kidnapped him. You killed him. You dumped his body into the city’s filth-ridden river like a broken instrument.

But [[Karlock]] saw something. Just for a second: a skeletal figure *([[Karlock's Devil]])* cloaked in ghostlight, pressing a finger to his lips.

_Shh._

You left the city the next morning and headed for the coast, stopping in a quiet village called _[[Bellwood]]_. There, a job caught your eye—a contract to clear out an old, abandoned manor nearby.

You arrived just before dusk, wind pushing against the creaking wood of the place. You peered over the hill at the decaying house, its windows like blind eyes watching you back.

Something’s waiting inside.
