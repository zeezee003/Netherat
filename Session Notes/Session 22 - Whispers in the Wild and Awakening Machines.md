### Session 22 Recap — _Whispers in the Wild and Awakening Machines_

The session opened in the aftermath of a meteor-like crash—the talking skull [[Eoran]] discovered slammed into the ground at the tavern. After a morning spent shopping with a mysterious traveling merchant, the party pushed onward toward [[Drens]], chasing rumors of a dormant mechanical army left behind by a mad wizard.

On the road, a pillar of smoke marked a grim scene—fallen [[Haratha Paladin]]s, killed moments before your arrival. Among the bodies, a dead paladin’s hand clutched a strange necklace, its pull undeniable.

Suddenly, a mouse—[[Mathias]]—halted the party and introduced himself, backed by a cadre of armed woodland creatures. They fought alongside a man named [[Redfell]], leading the crusade against [[Garold Grimtower]] and his paladins. The revelation hit [[Callum]] hard: Redfell was his uncle, the man who raised him. Torn, [[Callum]] chose to stay with family, parting ways with the group—for now.

The necklace guided you toward a ravine where three hobgoblins lay in wait. [[Galvatross]]’s cunning unraveled their plans before the party struck, wiping them out. Digging deeper, you found a trapped robot, its chest cavity empty—until the necklace slid into place, sparking it back to life.

[[Cygnus]] discovered a hidden door within the cavern walls, leading into darkness. A scream echoed below; rushing in, you found worms devouring deep gnomes. After slaying one worm and sending the other fleeing, a grateful deep gnome led you to an abandoned duergar city, revealing the severed head of a malevolent machine—an ominous warning.
