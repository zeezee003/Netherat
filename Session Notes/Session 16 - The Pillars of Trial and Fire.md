### _Session 16: The Pillars of Trial and Fire_

You regrouped with **[[Orin]]**, the grizzled dwarf you first spotted on that rickety cart entering [[Sarthal]]—a man whose quiet steadiness belied a steel-forged past. The reunion felt tense but familiar, a brief moment of calm before the storm.

The group found themselves standing in a massive chamber, its scale humbling. **Four colossal pillars rose from the floor**, each etched with ancient runes glowing faintly with arcane power. Shadows flickered as the chamber’s firelight danced on the stone.

Between the pillars lay a daunting **moat of molten lava**, its heat washing over your skin like a living thing.

Orin’s voice, low and measured, broke the silence:  
_“This place... it’s no ordinary trial. Each pillar guards a secret, a test—only by passing them can we hope to proceed.”_

### The Four Trials

You knew from whispered legends and bitter experience what the pillars represented:

- **The Lava Moat**: A treacherous barrier of searing flame and flowing rock. Crossing it would require more than mere agility—perhaps magic, cunning, or sheer guts.
    
- **The Fiery Horn**: A mystical artifact said to call forth ancient power or awaken sleeping terrors. How to wield it? That was the question.
    
- **The Riddle Sand Room**: A chamber where time itself seemed to flow like grains of sand—each riddle a key, every misstep a punishment. Logic and wit would be your weapons here.
    
- **The Dragon Tomb**: The final resting place of a forgotten wyrm. The air smelled of ash and old bones. Disturbing this sanctum could awaken more than memories.

### Where We Pick Up

_The party stands at the threshold of these four ancient tests, the heat of the lava moat on one side, the eerie glow of the dragon’s tomb on the other, and the whispers of riddles and horn calls filling the air._

Orin eyes you all sharply, hands resting on the haft of his axe:  
_"Choose wisely, for each path shapes the fate of those who dare tread it. And not all who enter return whole."_
