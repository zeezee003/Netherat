### _Session 9: The Stone Curse and the Silent Girl_

The manor loomed like a forgotten memory, wind rustling the trees as the party crept onto its grounds. The statues lining the yard weren’t just eerie—they were _frozen mid-motion_, their poses tense, fearful. Something had caught them in the act of fleeing.

[[Dayne]] slipped ahead, entering the barn unseen. Inside, gnashing and tearing echoed in the darkness—a massive _basilisk_ feasting on a half-eaten horse.

Combat exploded across the courtyard. Steel met scale. But not before [[Dayne]] locked eyes with the beast—and froze, petrified in mid-action, a living statue now among the others.

The battle was bloody but brief. When the creature fell, its eyes crystallized into two dark gemstones, humming with latent power. The party gathered around their frozen comrade, channeling divine energy. With _three combined castings of Lesser Restoration_, [[Dayne]]’s stony flesh cracked and gave way to life once more.

The manor itself waited with breathless malice.

Inside, you found the corpse of a lone adventurer—clearly trying to flee something unseen. In his hands, two items: a strange _lantern_ and an exquisite _[[pirate’s cutlass]]_. [[Dayne]] claimed the sword without hesitation. [[Galvatross]] took the lantern, discovering its power: it revealed ghostly imprints of the past—echoes burned into reality.

Room by room, the manor told its story. A girl’s voice, faint sobs, fleeting figures disappearing around corners. Her toys, her dress, her comb—all scattered and stained by time. The house _remembered_ her. And now, so did you.

Each of you was tested—by fear, by memory, by guilt. And each of you emerged changed, stronger for having touched the pain soaked into this place.

In the servants’ quarters, you placed a toy car inside a fallen toy box. A figure appeared in the hall where you’d first entered. A little girl, eyes empty, sadness clinging to her like shadow.

She raised a finger to her lips.

_Shh._
