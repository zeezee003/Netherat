### **Session 34 — “The Kraken, the Pact, and the Falling Star”**

_Welcome back to Netherat… or what’s left of it._

The battle against the **[[kraken]]** was over, but its monstrous corpse still steamed on the battlefield—a carcass hiding more than just rot.

**[[Wyll Overview]]**, having been swallowed during the fight, emerged from the beast’s belly. Inside, he had seen **a vision**: his brother **[[Michael]]**, wounded and dying, and beside him, a radiant **sword pulsing with divine light**. The inner walls of the kraken were etched with an unnatural **map of stars**, constellations stitched into flesh.

Elsewhere, **[[Ciwin]]** discovered a truth more dangerous than any relic: **[[Karlock]] had struck a pact with a devil**—a secret he had kept from the party. Tensions rose. **[[Dayne]]** and **[[Gal]]**, trying to understand the source of [[Karlock]]’s fear of the holy sword [[Wyll Overview]] had seen, found themselves suddenly **bound into the same infernal contract**. No choice. No escape. Their souls now _linked_ to [[Karlock]]’s deal.

At the same time, **[[Jingles]]** followed a strange pull through the ruins and found a prisoner: a **[[dragon trapped in human form]]**, its chest glowing with the same **star pattern** seen inside the [[kraken]]. The implications were staggering—something ancient and celestial was unfolding around them, older than gods, older than devils.

Then came **[[Grawl]]**, war leader of the orcs, appearing in the box of the arena. He addressed Jingles directly:

> “Come to **[[Anguis]]**.”

But whatever diplomacy he hoped for was shattered when he turned and **punched [[Karlock]] in the jaw**, hard and fast. The room froze.

The **orc alliance** was gone—splintered by mistrust, secrets, and the stink of devil’s flame. Whatever peace you had brokered with them was now dust.
