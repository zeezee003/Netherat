### _Session 3: Strange Fire and Shifting Paths_

The trail led them to a secluded cave where kobolds huddled around a cloaked figure, deep in hushed conversation. Before the party could intervene, the figure vanished into the treeline, leaving only scaled minions behind. [[Dayne]] made an attempt to sneak closer—but whatever grace he had in mind was met with immediate detection. The kobolds hissed, retreated, and combat erupted before the party could even enter the cave mouth.

Outnumbered, the fight was rough. Among the enemies stood one kobold larger than the rest—armed, brutal, and clearly in command. But the group held their ground, blades flashing and spells flying, until the last of the attackers lay broken.

Inside the cave, they barricaded themselves and rested. By lanternlight, they examined strange barrels filled with purplish rock-like material—half crystalline, half organic. [[Callum]], curious and cautious, took one with them as they left the next morning.

But dawn revealed something more troubling: the kobold corpses they’d left behind had been torn apart. Not scavenged—_devoured_. Flesh shredded, bones split. Something had come in the night. Something not interested in mercy.

Avoiding the main roads, the group made for [[Sarthall]] through the woods. Just before the city gates, they buried the barrel in secret and entered the town, seeking answers.

There, they met [[Jons]], the weathered captain of the guard, barking orders at young recruits. [[Voro]] wasted no time—showing the soldiers how a real bowman moves. He struck targets with precision, and the young martial took notice. The magic in him hadn't surfaced yet… but the moment hinted at something stirring beneath the surface.

[[Jons]] agreed to help. Two guards joined the group to retrieve the hidden barrel—but when they returned to the site, they found only a hole. The barrel was gone. Just a smear of the strange purple substance remained in the dirt.

Then [[Crag]], one of the guards, tasted it.

A mistake—or maybe destiny.

His veins bulged, pulsing with violet light. His muscles swelled grotesquely as power surged through him. With a roar, he hurled a massive club, burying it into a thick tree. And then—calmly, deliberately—he conjured a flickering purple flame in his hand.

Something was changing. The substance wasn’t just strange—it was _alive_ with power.
