### _Session 4: Grimms and Gamblefire_

The strange purple trail left behind by the missing barrel drew the party’s attention. They followed its drag marks through the woods until the trail faded. Whatever had taken the barrel was strong—and deliberate.

Returning to [[Sarthall]], the party checked in with Captain [[Jons]] before making their way to the palace. There, they met with the court wizard, [[Ciwin]]—a reclusive scholar whose mind had long been bent toward studying the mad zealots and the strange violet dust that seemed tied to their transformation. [[Ciwin]] confirmed their suspicions: the purple substance was alchemical, volatile, and increasingly common in zealot activity. He advised investigating a sewer entrance hidden behind the [[Grimm Family Casino]].

The group headed to the casino under dusk’s heavy sky. Inside, neon glitz met bloodsport. They met [[Hank Grimm]], one of the infamous brothers who ran the joint, and placed bets on the evening's pit fights—one of the city’s more brutal pastimes.

Fate had other plans.

When a contestant collapsed mid-event from a heart attack, the announcer,[[ Mike Grimm]], turned to the crowd. He needed fresh blood. His gaze locked on [[Callum]]. “You,” he said. “Get in.”

[[Callum]] stepped into the ring. The crowd roared.

He fought well—nimble, fierce—but was ultimately defeated in the quarterfinals by a halfling brawler named _[[Halfroc]]_. [[Halfroc]] proved himself in the ring, eventually taking the championship by laying out a known predator named [[Damathos]] to wild cheers.

Despite the loss, [[Callum]]’s courage didn’t go unnoticed. He was invited to the exclusive VIP section behind the fight pit. With the blood of battle still drying on his skin, he stepped through the velvet-draped doorway—into a world of secrets the public wasn’t meant to see.
