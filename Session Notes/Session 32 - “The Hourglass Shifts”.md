### **Session 32 — “The Hourglass Shifts”**

Still deep in the Feywild, the party launched into a desperate rescue mission as **[[Ciwin]]**, a satyr named **[[Hank]]**, and **[[Natalie Portman]]** were chained in an arena, with a hulking **frog-beast** looming over them. **[[Jingles]]** leapt from the balcony into the pit, landing a brutal strike, while **[[Wyll Overview]]** and **[[Gal]]** faced the four Eladrin leaders above.

The battle split in two. Below, **[[Karlock]]** banished [[Ciwin]] to the Material Plane mid-combat to protect him. [[Natalie Portman]] wasn’t so lucky—she was swallowed by the beast, and though you eventually brought it down, she died. Her body was expelled, and the party claimed the **Necklace of Adaptation** from her remains.

On the balcony, tension rose as the **[[Fall Eladrin]]** tried to calm the crowd. Suddenly, a **massive troll** crashed down onto him, **instantly killing him**. Chaos erupted. Trolls began **raining down** into the palace—**a full-scale siege** had begun.

Aboard a summoned griffon, [[Wyll Overview]] lifted allies to the balcony as the battle intensified. You witnessed the **[[Summer Eladrin]]'s throat slit by a troll**, their body flickering and transforming into a **lifeless mannequin**. The **[[Spring Eladrin]]** panicked and fled deeper into the palace.

**[[Ciwin]]**, now fully alert and dead serious, urged pursuit. You split up, chasing the [[Spring Eladrin]] through twisting fey corridors that mocked reason and logic. One group became trapped in a **cylindrical aquarium**, sharks circling below. A clever puzzle-solving escape brought them to an empty room—safe, but lost.

Meanwhile, the second group encountered **illusory doors**—each personalized, whispering temptations. All resisted the enchantments…except **[[Dayne]]**, who stepped through a portal into his past.

He stood again aboard his father’s ship in the **[[Shadowfell]]**, where a hooded figure (his father?) stood facing away. The figure turned, shushed him with a finger, and pointed upward. There, spreading its wings before a fake, pale moon, was the unmistakable wraith-form of **[[Karakos]]—[[Chaos]] incarnate**. Dread took hold before [[Dayne]] was yanked back into the Feywild.

When he returned, his friends had already subdued the **[[Spring Eladrin]]**, who also flickered into a mannequin upon defeat.

Reunited with [[Ciwin]] in a courtyard under siege, your escape was nearly blocked. **Gigantic chunks of the palace were being torn into the sky**, levitating toward some unseen force. [[Ciwin]], eyes wide, whispered in reverent terror:

> _“He’s here.”_

A **[[colossal wind dragon]]**, swirling with violent storm magic, descended through the clouds—**one of the Seven**, the avatar of **Air itself**. Its first breath attack made it clear: this wasn’t a fight you could win.

[[Ciwin]] cast a **wall of force**, giving you moments to act. A shattered **crystal** opened a rift home—your only exit.

You stumbled back into **[[Netherat]]**… but not the one you left.

The ancient elven ruins from your earliest adventures were still there—but no longer buried beneath trees and vines. Now, they stood alone in the middle of a vast **desert wasteland**. Time had passed. **A lot of it.**

The Feywild's strange clock had shifted reality itself.
