### _Session 14: The Shadow, the Storm, and the Dagger_

_Not all battles are fought with blades._

You stood aboard the phantom vessel of **[[Galdore]]**, the ancient druid who abandoned the surface world for a sea beneath the ice. The air was thick with threat as **swords floated around him like sharks**, waiting for his command. But words—steady and measured—stayed the blades.

Yet **[[Dayne]] was already unraveling.** The pressure, the possession, the truths left unspoken—he broke for the edge of the boat. _[[Karlock]]_, rolling a natural 20, **tackled him to the deck**, saving him from diving into madness or sea.

[[Galdore]] asked **[[Callum]]** a single question: _“Do you trust me?”_ Then, with no hesitation, drove a **dagger of ancient make** into [[Dayne]]’s ribs.

### _Descent._

[[Dayne]] fell into darkness—and into **memory**.

- **A field near his childhood home**, swallowed by shadow.
    
- _[[Alred]] voice_: corrosive, relentless. “You’ve failed everyone.”
    
- A **vision of a twisted, monstrous Callum** emerged—_a manifestation of self-hatred_—and struck him down.
    

### _Scene Shift._

- **The family cabin.** The past breathed here.
    
- [[Galvatross]]’ voice _pierced the noise_. That clarity revealed the truth: _[[Alred]] wasn’t a voice of guilt. He was a demon of possession. A liar. A parasite._
    
- Its true form was revealed—twisted, sneering, patient.
    

### _Scene Shift Again._

- **[[The Helix]]**, where [[Dayne]] grew into himself. But even here, _[[Voro]]_’s presence couldn't reach him.
    
- The shadow-possessed [[Voro]] stepped forward—and **attacked**.
    

### _Final Scene: The Ship of the Father._

- The true battlefield.
    
- [[Dayne]] stood aboard his father’s vessel—**the place of legacy**.
    
- _[[Karlock]]’s voice was a lighthouse through the fog_, healing [[Dayne]] in body and soul. A **nat 20 speech** brought him back from the brink.
    

And then came the final duel.

**[[Alred]]’s demonic form** lunged with hatred. [[Dayne]] matched him blow for blow. As both teetered on the edge of death, **a dagger appeared in [[Alred]]’s gut—plunged not by a hand, but by will.**

The demon fell.

And in the quiet aftermath, [[Dayne]] saw his father—clear, proud, and vanishing.

> _“Find me, son. Come and find me.”_

[[Dayne]] _awoke_, reborn, surrounded by friends.

But the moment left no time for rest.

**[[Ciwin]] appeared**, holding the trembling form of the young elven boy—now crackling with unstable arcane energy. _The power had to go somewhere._ Before he could finish the sentence, **[[Voro]] stepped forward**, without hesitation, and **absorbed the raw storm into himself.**

_And he changed._

Forever.

The deck quieted. You were not the same people who stepped onto that ship.

Then Galdore smiled faintly. _“I have a godson who could use your help.”_ He opened a portal—a shimmer of otherworldly light—and you glimpsed a **halfling barbarian**, mid-scream, **wrecking a bandit gang like a divine cannonball in leather armor.**

> _“Alright—he may not need your help... but it looks like you could use his.”_

### _Session 15: The Merchant, the Machine, and the Duel of Fate_

You began still aboard [[_Galdore]]’s spectral vessel_, floating across the memory-stained waters of a sea that does not exist. The ancient druid explained why he exiled himself below the ice. His words turned toward older battles still shaping your path—**[[the Blood War]]**, that eternal, infernal conflict between Devils and Demons.

More unsettling still: [[Ciwin]] spoke of **[[Harold]]'s death**, and of _whispers from the mountains_. Rumors of a silent army of **machines**, hidden deep in the stone, waiting. Unblinking.

With answers (and more questions), you departed the ship through [[Galdore]]’s portal, finding yourselves back in the waking world.

### _Enter: The Halfling_

You caught up with the **halfling barbarian** [[Jingles]]—not hard, as he was about as stealthy as a thunderclap. But before you could say much, a **wizard** among you cast a spell that caused the halfling to bolt.

Your pursuit was cut short by a **hobgoblin ambush**. The halfling fought beside you in the chaos, and—after a shared victory soaked in blood and banter—**chose to stay**.

_Friendship, forged through violence. The classic way._

---

### _The Deck of Many Futures_

Then, from nowhere and everywhere, a **traveling merchant** appeared. Smooth voice, crooked smile, gilded words. He offered **wondrous treasures**, each far beyond your means—**for a single draw** from his deck of fate.

One by one, you reached out.

- Some drew **gifts**—boons, blessings, perhaps curses cleverly disguised.
    
- Others weren’t so lucky.
    

And then, the wizard took his turn.

The card glowed with unnatural heat. A **summoning**—a **duelbound challenge from beyond the veil**. Time stilled. The air cracked.

A **foe from another plane** stepped forth, summoned by fate to settle the debt in blood.

> One spellcaster. One enemy. No help.  
> This is where we left it:  
> **A 1v1 fight to the death.**
