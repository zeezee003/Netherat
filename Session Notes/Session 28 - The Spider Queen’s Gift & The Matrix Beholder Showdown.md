### Session 28 Recap — _The Spider Queen’s Gift & The Matrix Beholder Showdown_

You began the session still riding the momentum from atop the defeated scrap monster, its mechanical carcass fizzing with unstable energy before exploding in a fiery shockwave. You barely escaped the ensuing sinkhole collapse, plunging into a dark, comb-like labyrinth coated with viscous, web-like strands—an unsettling maze that felt alive and watchful.

As you scattered across different levels of the maze, mechanical spiders emerged—sleek, merciless, and clearly designed to defend this twisted nest. You fought fiercely, protecting your unconscious allies while navigating this sticky underworld.

Eventually, your path led to a giant spider’s lair—a cavernous nest pulsing with hundreds of metallic spider eggs, an eerie fusion of organic and machine. The air thickened with tension as a massive spider queen descended—ominous yet strangely serene.

Thanks to [[Cygnus]]’s insight, you discerned the queen’s true intent: she meant no harm, but rather a warning. She guided you toward a single, anomalous organic egg standing apart from the cold metallic masses. You claimed the third beacon nestled beside this unique egg—and, after some hesitation, took the organic egg as well, sensing its importance despite the unsettling nature of your discovery.

Seeking refuge and respite, your group ventured deeper, weary but determined. Soon the fourth beacon pinged rapidly—approaching fast from around a bend. The armor pieces scattered ahead bore familiar signs—fragments of necron tech, but worn by none other than your Kuo-Toa allies. Battle-hardened and armored in scavenged steel, they delivered the final beacon cell to you, proving their valor and resilience.

You seized this moment to long rest and resupply, grateful for the calm before the storm.

Returning to the mad wizard [[Eveus]]’s study, the atmosphere shifted: the entrance was eerily ajar, signaling danger. Within, an uncanny apparition flickered—a [[beholder]] made not of flesh but cascading lines of matrix-like data, its voice a cold AI whisper directly inside your minds.

This digital menace offered a tempting bargain: leave now, spare the corrupted machine’s core, and walk away with the mk.1 mech army intact—and, cryptically, reclaim something lost. The scent of tobacco filled the air, hinting at past betrayals and personal stakes.

Unwavering, you refused the offer, initiating a brutal showdown. The fight was chaotic—magic and glitching tech warping reality itself. In a wild twist, Eoran and the legendary Dayne swapped places through some arcane glitch tied to Shadowfell’s dark magic.

Dayne’s return turned the tide, pushing you to victory, but not without cost—[[D&D - Player/00 Netherat/Voro]] was struck down, unconscious from the beholder’s deadly death ray.
