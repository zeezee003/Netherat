### Session 26 Recap — _The Core, the Dragon, and the Riddles of Dartanian_

You opened on a long, narrow bridge suspended above the mechanical graveyard, the ground below littered with decaying necron skeletons, silent sentinels of a forgotten war. The silence was eerie—these were no mere corpses but lingering echoes of corrupted constructs.

With careful precision, you navigated past the brittle remains and pressed on toward what you hoped was the core of this infernal machine fortress.

Your efforts brought you into a peculiar chamber: a raised central platform circled by four smaller ones, an imposing door on the far side emblazoned with a giant eye symbol. This was no ordinary door, but the entrance to a trial — and a challenge that awaited you was nothing less than a **[[mechanical dragon]]** of terrifying repute.

The battle was fierce and tactical. This was no simple beast, but a crafted guardian, presumably one of many traps designed to protect the wizard [[Eveus]]’s secrets. The dragon’s metallic scales shimmered with menace as it lashed out, its attacks blending brute force with arcane machinery.

Ultimately, the party triumphed, and Jingles claimed the dragon’s core—an organ-like artifact, pulsating with an eerie energy, likely the heart powering the beast’s relentless fury.

Pressing forward, you entered the inner sanctum—[[Cygnus]]’s knowledge revealing it to be his late master’s office, a place dense with arcane secrets and mechanical wonders. The tension of battle was replaced by eerie stillness, save for the quiet testament of the wizard’s demise.

Among the treasures was a **bronze staff** resting on the throne, alongside several intriguing pieces of gear that hinted at the wizard’s past power and technological mastery.

But before gaining full access to the knowledge held within, you faced **[[Dartanian]]**, the owl guardian bound to the master’s will. This was no mere animal but an intelligent sentinel who demanded passage through a series of riddles—enigmatic puzzles testing your wits and resolve.

Passing these tests, you were granted the wizard’s journal. Its pages detailed a desperate plan: to stop the necron corruption by shutting down their core systems—but with a twist. The plan involved overriding the existing controls to maintain access to the **mk 1 bots**, presumably less corrupted or even salvageable for your own ends.

To do this, you would need to secure **three additional cores** to join the one Jingles had acquired. Only by gathering and syncing all four could the system be overridden safely.

[[Cygnus]], enhanced with newly acquired upgrades, now sports a heads-up display (HUD) interface—a technological boon allowing him to hack, navigate, and extract data from the wizard’s archives with unprecedented ease.

Seizing the opportunity, you jumped aboard a flying beetle and descended into the scrapyard’s depths. At the bottom, as you pursued the beacon pinged on [[Cygnus]]’s map, you found yourselves stalked by **circular-jawed sharks**—mechanical predators designed to chew scrap and fuel the maze’s relentless growth.

Escaping the jaws of these relentless hunters, you reached a towering mound of scrap—the beacon’s location. But just as you approached, the mound came alive, transforming into a giant scrap monster bristling with blades and saws. You found yourselves standing atop, clutching for balance on this living nightmare of recycled destruction.
